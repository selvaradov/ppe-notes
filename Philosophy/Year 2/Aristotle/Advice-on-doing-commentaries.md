- You have one hour for four commentaries, i.e. 15min for each.
- Spend about half of it analysing the passage, you can show your understanding of the text, context in terms of location & what it’s setting up, Aristotelian terminology
- Choose some aspects of the passage to focus on, say what those are, and why you’ve chosen to focus on them (maybe they’re most important for the rest of the book, most susceptible to objections, etc)
- Doesn’t necessarily need to be a negative critique
- Stefan says:
  - "For the commentaries the main thing would be to keep the focus on the specifics of the passage in question and assess them philosophically. What point is being made in the passage? Is the claim/argument being made compelling or not? Why? How does the relate to what Aristotle says elsewhere? Does it raise any further interesting philosophical questions? Etc."
