FORMALISATION



Adequacy: Assume that ϕ and all elements of Γ are L2-sentences. Then Γ ⊢ ϕ if and only if Γ ⊧ ϕ.



Syntactic consistency: A set Γ of L2-sentences is syntactically consistent iff there is a sentence ϕ such that Γ ⊢/ ϕ (i.e. it doesn't contain a contradiction and you can't do ex falso quodlibet



Semantic consistency <-> syntactic consistency.



Scope ambiguity



Extensional ambiguity - you can substitute designators denoting the same object for one another without changing the truth-value of a sentence

o but English is not extensional

- e.g. sentences with 'that' in them, say 'I think that water is wet' =/= '...H2O is wet', where the object X has multiple designators which refer to it but I don't realise that



in order to show that an English argument is not valid in predicate logic, one needs to consider its full formalisation.
