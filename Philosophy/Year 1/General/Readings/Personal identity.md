### Nature of personhood
> - The identification question: What properties must a being have to count as a person?
> - The reidentification question: What makes a person the same person over time?
> - The characterization question: What makes a person the person that she is?
- Set aside epistemological questions (about the existence of *other* minds), and also about moral personhood (do non-human animals count, etc)
- Locke: importance of self-reflection and self-awareness.
	- Have to be able to perceive that you can perceive
- Frankfurt: free will returns to rear its head. 
	- He says you need to have second-order volitions in order for personhood
	- (volitions are slightly different to desires; you may have many competing desires. But volition is the thing you end up *willing* i.e. whatever wins out.)
	- "Wantons" lack second-order volitions. So the having free will (when construed as having the wills that you want to have) is not a problem for them (since they don't care how their will is), and this means - according to Frankfurt - that they lack personhood
- Want to avoid being anthropocentric and excluding possibility that other animals have personhood
### Psychological approach
- Qualitative vs quantitative identity
- Ship of Theseus
- Locke: personal identity is about connections of memory
- Thomas Reid: transitivity objection
	- Maybe old man remembers thing from young man and young man remembers thing from boy, but no memories shared from boy to old man
	- Can reply with the continuity of memory instead
- Temporary amnesia / dreaming objections
	- Can maybe say that the memories just need to be potentially accessible \[but if you have amnesia then they aren't really...]
- Circularity issues
	- Memory seems to presuppose identity: S can only remember p if S actually experienced p, but then we need an account of what S is and isn't
	- Can use causal analyses of memory here, rather like as done in knowledge
	- But what is the "appropriate" kind of causal connection? Perry 1975, “Personal Identity, Memory, and the Problem of Circularity.”
- Quasi-memories
- Besides the psychological view, there is the physical view, and a non-reductionist view that talks about souls and stuff
	- \[maybe want to criticise existence of souls? but not sure if worth engaging with]
- Some thought experiments to show intuition that we prize psychological connectedness over physical when doing reidentification
- Grumbles about thought experiments
	- Response that the scenarios aren't so scientifically fanciful after all
	- And also that the fact that they are *possible* supports the psychological account, because (apparently) a conceptualisation of identity should be a necessary truth \[I don't see at all why that'd be true]
	- \[more saliently, even if we actually can use transporters and soul splitters and so on, we are *never* going to invent an "identity detector device" - we'd still be relying on intuitions to decide whether we think the individuals appearing on the other end are the same or not. So the key issue I have with thought experiments is not the imaginativeness (though that is one reason to doubt their importance for my own practical ethics) but rather their reliance on subjective intuitions, **even if implementable in reality**]
### Reduplication problem
- Bernard Williams is back...
	- Charles, Robert, and Guy Fawkes. 
	- I don't think I am wholly convinced, from the sketch of the thought experiment, that "we have two different men who are both psychologically continuous with Guy Fawkes".
		- I guess this is kind of possible if they are kind-of psychologically continuous but not totally identical to Guy Fawkes, and so there's enough difference between Charles <-> Fawkes <-> Robert for them to be non-identical to each other.
	- It's kind of similar to a transitivity problem
- Parfit and his transporter causing fission
#### Non-branching requirement
- Identity is a one-to-one relation whereas psychological continuity can be one-to-many
- So continuity isn't sufficient for identity
- But this is a bit of a difficult position to hold since -- kind of like externalism in knowledge? -- it relies on facts about other things to establish whether P_1 === P_2 (specifically, whether or not there is a P_3 which also exists and is continuous. Even when subjectively to P_2 there seems to be no difference if that P_3 exists or not, on the other side of the world.)

#### Identity doesn't matter
- There is a point from Parfit raised in SEP about ethics that I really like.
- "since my \[Much Later Self] would really be more like a different person than me, he should be treated as such, i.e., how I treat him should now fall under the rubric of _morality_, and insofar as it is wrong to harm others without their consent, it would be wrong for me to harm him as well. Great imprudence like this, in other words, would be _immoral_ (Parfit 1984, 318–320)."
#### Four-dimensionalism
- Problem of overpopulation - makes it impossible to know how many people "I" am right now, since perhaps in the future I will split up into lots of persons and we'll no longer be overlapping in time
### Physical approach
- The deprograminator and reprograminator thought experiment
	- Hmm, I think maybe we're just getting confused by intuitions here 
	- But it does seem to push us a bit towards caring about bodies
	- The thing is in all our evolutionary history bodies and "minds"/brains go together, so I am not sure how well our intuitions can generalise to these scenarios (or why we are taking them as the source of truth.....)
#### Bodily theory
- If the bodies are numerically identical
- But this is super vague, what about amputations, transplants, etc
- Or the Asimov(?) short story with all the court cases where people get silicon implants and the robot gets a tiny bit of organic implant
- Doesn't fit with intuitions about brain transplant and upload from a person whose body dies
- Also how about the case of dicephalus where two brains share one conjoined body
#### Animalism
- Points out that psychological accounts are not useful for animals like cockroaches
- Requires biological continuity instead
- Argument that the seemingly-true statement "I was once a foetus" seems incompatible with psychological accounts of identity
	- \[response: we are using the word "I" in a different sense here; rather like how one might say "I was once stardust"]
- Also tries to appeal to intuitions about people in a persistent vegetative state - they are still the same person as they were before; identity hasn't been lost. Which is only possible with biological rather than psychological continuity account
	- Response: just deny that they still exist as the same person
- Thinking animal argument **\[didn't understand this, will look in SEP maybe]**
	- Personal identity can come apart from animal identity according to psychological account, e.g. when we do a brain transplant no "animal" is transplanted \[what precisely is "animal"?]
	- \[I think my problem with this argument initially is that although it may be the case that I'm temporarily occupying a body or an animal (on the psychological account, given that "I" can survive a change of body/animal), and so cannot be numerically identical to that body/animal, that does not prevent it being true that _at this very moment_ I am some particular human animal. In other words, the conclusion that "Therefore, you are a human animal" is simply a statement about how the world is currently, rather than a claim that my identity is intimately tied up with being this very specific human animal that I currently "am" i.e. inhabit. You can draw an analogy with the sentence "I am a student", for instance?]
	- Also apparently has a too-many-thinkers objection/problem (unclear naming). But related to four-dimensionalism
- Again, doesn't allow for continued identity in upload or transplant cases, or dicephalus being distinct persons
#### Brain theory
- \[Whoah now there's Jeff McMahan too, truly the academic treasures are out today]
- "*The embodied mind theory*: A at time t1 is identical to B at some later time t2 if and only if there is sufficient non-branching physical and functional continuity between A's brain and B's brain to preserve certain basic psychological capacities, particularly the capacity for consciousness."
	- Note that this requires some physical continuity - replacement of brain cells allowed but only gradually
	- Also the psychological content doesn't need to necessarily be preserved, just the capacities \[why & what does this actually mean in thought experiments/practice?]
- Aha, some thought experiments: persistent vegetative state, temporary but deep coma, Alchzeimers' disease
	- On the psychological account, loss in continuity means individuals cease to exist
	- On the bodily account/animalism, individuals do still exist
	- On the embodied mind theory, the PVT does cease to exist. The deep coma does not (still have the capacities). Alchzeimers' verdict depends on whether there is the "capacity for consciousness" \[but of course operationalising this is v vague and a huge point of argument in itself]
- Can deal with dicephalus and brain swap. 
- But in teleportation case, and the brain uploading case, there's physical discontinuity in the brain. So the person ceases to exist, which maybe is unintuitive
- Also developmentally, foetus only gets complex enough for consciousness in third trimester so we don't exist before that \[this is of course perhaps an attractive feature rather than problem for people like McMahan, etc, who want to oppose Don Marquis-type views on abortion]

- Problem of dissociative personality disorders for the physical accounts
	- They seem to be multiple persons, within one physical enclosure
	- Also how about psychics and so on. Or thought experiments with chip implants that cause different neural pathways to fire when activated etc etc \[on the embodied brain experiment maybe this leads to a lack of continuity? but unclear]

### Divided minds
- This is quite a cool idea, I remember Yudhi telling me about someone who tried / succeeded?? to divide up their mind
