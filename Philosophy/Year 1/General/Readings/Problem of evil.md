### logical argument
- Mackie as the first person to present the problem as a challenge to existence of God rather than just a theological wrinkle to iron out
	- Presents the logical argument rather than evidential
	 *(1) God exists. 
	 (2) God is omnipotent. 
	 (3) There are no limits to what an omnipotent being can do. 
	 (4) God is omnibenevolent.
	 (5) A good being eliminates evil as far as it can 
	 together entail (6) Evil does not exist, which is false, so reject (1)*
	- accepts that (3) and (5) are controversial
- the omnipotence called for by (2) must be of the sort that doesn't allow God to do logical contradictions, otherwise it could simply make all of those (1) through (6) consistent and there is no problem of evil
> Robert Adams, speaking of the logical problem, has insisted that “it is fair to say that Plantinga \[in his Free Will Defence] has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of the \[set of propositions endorsed by the theist]” (1985, 226).
- Note that the defence must only show that the set of propositions is not inconsistent, i.e. it is *possible* for all of them to be true
- (5) isn't logically true or required for theism. 
	- e.g. killing everyone would eliminate evil.
	- So modify to (5”) "A good being eliminates evil as far as it can, provided that \[it is reasonable for the being to believe that], in doing so, no greater goods are destroyed and no worse evils are created."
	- alongside the assumption that (GG) "An omnipotent and omnibenevolent being could have eliminated the evil we find in the world without destroying greater goods and without creating worse evils" this yields a contradiction, but (GG) is not necessarily true
- theistic set: (1) God exists, (2) omnipotent, (3) omnibenevolent, (4) omniscient, (5) evil exists
- (NR) There are no good reasons for an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being to permit evil.
	- and clearly this can't be logically true: people are obviously not going to know whether or not there are some good reasons 
	- characterises this part of Plantinga's argument as showing "that the formal contradiction has not been established and that it is going to be very hard ever to establish it."
- second part of Plantinga's argument: the theistic set is, in fact, formally consistent (i.e. the logical problem of evil will never be watertight)
	- by finding a proposition consistent with propositions (1) to (4) of the theistic set that, together with them, entails (5): namely, that evil exists.
	- (C) Free will is necessary for the highest goods and it was impossible for God to create a world containing free will without also creating a world containing evil.
	- Objection from Mackie - it's not logically true
	> 	why could he not have made men such that they always freely choose the good? If there is no logical impossibility in a man’s freely choosing the good on one, or on several occasions, there cannot be a logical impossibility in his freely choosing the good on every occasion.

	- objection rests on the idea that God can actualise any possible world
	- but (GFW) if God actualises the possible world in which everyone freely does the right thing, then the fact that he caused that to be the case eliminates the genuine free will that any agents might've had
	- Speak argues "it does not necessarily follow from the fact that a certain state of affairs is logically possible that an omnipotent being can bring it about."
		- --> sure, or to put it another way, there are some possible states of affairs \[hmm, but then in what sense are those states of affairs actually possible? if they arise stochastically, I guess] which are inconsistent with being caused by another being, so actualising those states of affairs is beyond the ability of even omnipotent beings, since doing that would be logically impossible
- Plantinga & transworld depravity: "a person is transworld depraved if she would do something morally wrong in any possible world in which she was actualized."
	- it is not logically impossible that every possible & actual person suffers transworld depravity
	- so, (C) is possibly true
	- so the theistic set is not inconsistent
	- William Alston’s conclusion that “Plantinga...has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing”
	- \[hmm, I'm confused here. I thought the goal was to show that (1) through (4) plus an extra proposition **entail** (5), not that the set is merely consistent. p35ish]
- an objection to the free will response: under a compatibilist view of free will, (GFW) isn't true
	- but, an objector taking this position needs to show that compatibilism is logically true
	- if incompatibilism is even just possible, then the theistic set isn't inconsistent
	- --> again, they're not showing (1) through (4) entails (5) though!
### evidential argument
- from William Rowe
	- “Empirical Premise” (EP): there are gratuitous evils.
	- “Theological Premise” (TP): if God exists, then there are no gratuitous evils \[surely this should be a probabilistic premiss, i.e. "there are unlikely to be gratuitous evils", or rephrase EP so it says "there appear to be gratuitous evils"]

> the theist could, as we will see in more detail later, simply accept the reasonability of the premises of Rowe’s argument but go on to claim that the positive evidence for theism outweighs the negative evidence constituted by the existence of apparently gratuitous evil.

- TP is quite easy to defend *a priori*
 > 	Since it is the absence of such overriding reasons that would make such evils gratuitous, an omnibenevolent and omniscient being will not permit gratui- tous evils.
- you could challenge it on the meaning of omniscience
	- maybe absolute reasons for removing evil come apart from rationalising ones
		- "Put roughly, God has an absolute reason to permit an instance of intense suffering if it is true that doing so would have no net moral cost. Equally roughly, God has a rationalizing reason to permit an instance of intense suffering if it is reasonable for God to act on the supposition that doing so would have no net moral cost."
	- i.e. God might be ignorant of the gratuitousness of some evils
	- Open Theism: some things (including future events which depend on the outcomes of free beings) are unknowable simpliciter, including by omniscient entities
		- --> ugh this is really quite a convoluted and silly line to take
	- so, for example, we can come up with "\[an instance of] suffering \[that] would not have been gratuitous if the sufferers had used their free will in the ways that God reasonably supposed they would \[but they didn't use their free will in those ways, so it did lead to a net moral loss]" 
- EP harder to defend
	- Apparently Rowe argues that "our inability to see any good reasons God could have for permitting \[evil] justifies us in concluding that there are no good reasons."
	- i.e. 
		(P): No good we know of justifies an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good being in permitting \[evil]
		(Q): No good at all justifies an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good being in permitting \[evil] === (EP)
		Rowe's inference: (P) gives very good grounds for accepting (Q)
	- --> again, this should be a probabilistic claim rather than a certain one
	- --> it's easy for a theist to say that (P) does not strictly imply (Q)
- two theistic responses:
	- show that EP is false (i.e. a theodicy; "an effort to identify a set of morally sufficient reasons God can plausibly be thought to have for permitting the evils in the world")
	- show that Rowe doesn't present enough evidence to make us believe EP is true ("sceptical theism" by denying Rowe's inference aka a "noseeum inference")
- sceptical theism
	- reject the assumption in Rowe's inference that "if there were goods that would justify omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good being in permitting \[evil] then we would probably know about them."
		- --> which is really really easy to do...
- Moorean shift
	- formulated in response to external world scepticism of the form 
		- (P1) I do not know that I am not a brain in a vat. (P2): (P1) -> I do not know I have hands. (C) global scepticism about the world outside our minds.
		- Moore's argument -- (P1*): I know I have hands. (P2): (P1) -> I do not know I have hands. (C) don't have to worry about global scepticism
		- \[some thoughts here: under the classical analysis, knowing X is a much higher bar to clear than not knowing X. In particular, you can know X iff it is true. How can we be certain that we have hands? If we are, then trivially we are certain of loads of things. In a sense, both of these arguments feel like they beg the question, although maybe indirectly. (P1) *feels* like it begs the question less, but maybe only because we're happier accepting the idea that we don't **know** X than the idea that we do know ¬X. anyhow, unclear how you would show that P1* is true, esp given truth condition for knowledge. There's an evidential case that can be made, which needs to be done through other independent arguments, i.e. do I have other evidence that leads me to believe I have hands with high confidence, or that I am not a brain in a vat] 
	- can be used against (TP) in a similar way
		- (1*) God exists. (2). If God exists, then there are no gratuitous evils. (3*) Therefore, there are no gratuitous evils.
		- \[hmm, but this wouldn't change anybody's mind! we care only about gratuitous evils insofar as they give us information about the existence of God, not the other way round. If you have independent evidence to suggest that God does exist, then it is that which would inform your confidence level in God's existing.]
			- as Speak points out, teleological & cosmological arguments don't show that an omnibenevolent God exists
			- would need to rely on ontological or moral argument
		- --> there seems something a little suspicious about using some evidence E to conclude C, and then going in the opposite direction to say that new evidence E' must be wrong because it goes against C. how would a Bayesian approach this (i.e. uncertainty over evidence and maybe needing to change your credence in evidence and the hypothesis)?
	- there's more stuff about this but don't think it's that important
- does the Sceptical Theist argument entail too much scepticism?
	- it requires that you say P(we know about the goods from unexplained evil | there are such goods) is very low
	- which maybe leads to conclusions like "God could have reasons, then, for creating the world ten minutes ago so as to look billions of years old. God could have reasons for permitting an evil demon to deceive us into thinking we have hands when we are actually just brains in vats."
	- Speak says that these worries are not unique for sceptical theists; they can deploy whatever anti-sceptical argument anyone else does
		- "surely the epistemic humility that would lead one to think that we probably wouldn’t recognize the reasons that \[God] would have for allowing particular evils is not as unreasonable as the attitude toward epistemic possibilities exemplified by the radical skeptic.'"
	- moral scepticism: maybe intervening to reduce evil is also bad because that evil could be non-gratuitious
		- \[ahh and the easy response used to solve epistemic objection to utilitarianism (we have no special information to make us believe that any particular piece of suffering is non-gratuitous so this uncertainty cancels out and shouldn't weigh in on our decision making) isn't available here: the sceptical theist is committed to the view that **all** suffering is non-gratuitous]
		- extremely weak response that << ahh but only God has a justifying reason to allow evils to happen, ordinary people do not >>
			>given that God’s reasons for permitting E1 and E2 are, by hypothesis, not accessible to us, they can’t be our reasons. We can’t have those reasons, even if there are such reasons.
- then goes on to talk about problem of divine hiddenness (if God exists, where is it??) and attempts at theodicy
## SEP
- free will etc "The good of libertarian free will requires, in short, the _possibility_ of moral evil."
	- of course you can say free will is incoherent or libertarian free will logically false ("libertarian free will requires more than the mere absence of determinism, and the difficulty arises when one attempts to say what that something more is."; libertarian dilemma)
- "abstract" vs "concrete" formulations; "axiological" vs "deontological"
	- notes the point from Zagzebi about some theists caring more about God's intentions & motivations than judging goodness by outcomes/states of affairs.
- refutations
	- 5.1 seems to have some good rebuttals to epistemological defence summarised [The Problem of Evil (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#HumEpiLim) 
	- 5.2 there's that no best possible worlds defence and procreation asymmetry
	- 5.3 the ontological argument apparently shows that a benevolent God necessarily exists, which clearly "would entail that the proposition that God does not exist must have probability zero on any body of evidence whatever"
- other defences
	- 6.1 positive evidence for existence of God outweighs the negative evidence given by the existence of evil (when problem is presented in inductive rather than deductive/formal form)
		- but as Speak notes, most other arguments don't show that the omnipotent being would be omnibenevolent
	- 6.2 "belief that God exists is non-inferentially justified" \[huh?? how??]
		- well anyway they say this is irrelevant
	- 6.3 I don't get what it's saying
- theodicies
	- 7.1 "soul-making" (i.e. spiritual/virtuous growth etc)
		- rubbish they say
	- 7.2 libertarian free will
	- 7.3 libertarian free will is valuable only when there's the freedom to do great evil \[and presumably in 7.2 they show it doesn't require that?]
	- 7.4 natural laws are needed for humans to take actions, natural laws necessitate natural evil
		- again they say rubbish, could've been stopped by miracles (incl miracles that we don't notice)
	- 7.5 some religious theodicy which is apparently also rubbish
