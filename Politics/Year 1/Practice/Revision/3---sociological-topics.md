Social movements

- Definitions
  - Extra-institutional
  - Claim making
  - Challenging system
- Variations/types of social movements, participation, mobilisation
- What explains their success/failure

Empirical cases

Lots start in 1960s and peak in ‘70s

- Arab Spring
- US civil rights
- Environmental, peace
- May 1968
  - Postmaterialism
- Feminism, gay liberation

Types

- Typology based on kinds of actions used (Milkis & Tichenor 2019)
  - Institutional, non-institutional (militant), marginal (using neither), formative (using both)
  - Formative meant to be most effective, though reverse causality too
- Or based on type of goals
  - Probably you can’t have a social movement that doesn’t have any goals to change things

Participation

- Free rider problem
  - Selective incentives
- Resource mobilisation theory
  - Movement-level and individual-level
  - Those with the time / money to protest will join; they’re the least marginalised
- Grievance theory
  - People who’re most harmed at the moment
- Empirically what kinds of people participate?

Success

- Political opportunity structures

Party systems

- What is a party system
  - Dependent variable: (effective) number of electoral/legislative parties; size. Also what the parties are (spatial position, ideological family). Nature of competition between them
- Cleavages
  - Social cleavages -> political cleavage if it’s mobilised by a political actor and if people identify with it as an identity
  - Cross-cutting vs reinforcing cleavages
  - Larger number of parties when cleavages cross-cutting. But sometimes there is a dominant cleavage which means that parties organise along those lines
  - Can also get factionalism within parties
- Institutional side
  - What is an electoral system?
    - Set of rules
    - Measure with district magnitude. Gives us a continuous measure rather than dichotomous as majoritarian or proportional
    - Formal thresholds (in addition to the effective one due to district magnitude)
    - Other measures – volatility of electoral system, proportionality (ratio of votes to legislative seats)
    - Strategic effect and mechanical effect
  - Remember point about how district-level trends don’t necessarily scale to national-level ones. You could have only two parties per constituency but different ones for every constituency in the country. If a cleavage is correlated with geographic region then you may get more parties
- Interaction between sociological and institutional features.
  - Permissiveness of electoral system and demand from sociological
  - Political parties are able to shape the system (example of the two countries in Africa – in PCP, Posner) – strategic **heresthetics**
  - Political entrepreneurs creating demand for parties / activating particular cleavages
  - Electoral systems are created in an environment of partisan competition (Duverger)
- Methodology
  - Cross-national comparisons
  - Longitudinal
    - Changes in a country like Japan, NZ, Italy
    - Introduction of PR in Europe in 20^(th) century – parties making strategic choices about electoral system. E.g. working class becoming important as a cleavage, rightwing parties thought they’d consistently lose under majoritarian system (Boix)
  - Within-country variation
    - Different electoral systems for upper and lower house (in Australia?) Cox 1997
- Non-European theories
  - Imposition of electoral systems from elsewhere
  - Cleavages did not gradually become activated
  - Ethnicity also important
- Evolution of parties
  - Cadre/elite party -> mass party -> catch all party -> cartel party
- Questions
  - Why do party systems change?
  - What are the causes / consequences?

Voting behaviour

- Why do people have attachments?
  - Socialisation
  - Cleavages could in theory explain party ID on its own
    - Socialisation predicts that even if people no longer a member of that cleavage, they will keep party ID
    - Also if e.g. you’re a working class person growing up in an affluent area, you might be socialised to identify with right-wing party
- Effects of party ID
  - People take in new information in a way that’s favourable to the party – self-reinforcing stability
  - Voting behaviour more volatile than party ID which means that party ID is less useful at predicting behaviour if it’s causally after
- Very strong party ID in the US, applies less in multiparty systems where individuals may identify with party families
- Individual rationality
  - Select the party closest to them in policy space
  - Purely economic evaluation
  - Fiorina – bounded rationality
- Funnel of causality (the American Voter, Michigan model)
  - Remote causes: sociological features
  - Then party ID
  - Then proximate causes like attitudes to candidates etc
  - Then campaign events & how you process information
  - Finally the vote
  - Each part of the chain may influence the subsequent ones
- Dealignment
  - Post 1960s – freezing hypothesis
  - Sociological predictions of party ID become much less stable – higher volatility among individuals, emergence of left-liberal and far-right parties, decline in turnout, cleavage bases (e.g. class) of party support much less predictive
  - Competing interests possibly less important, more about values and less about material concerns?
  - Also people less likely to be socialised only within their cleavage so decisions made based on other things
  - Dalton, cognitive mobilisation
    - Dealignment happens most often among people who have higher levels of education
    - But, we sometimes also see that there’s more polarisation among higher-educated people
  - What about the USA?
    - Maybe people are better-able to sort themselves into Republican & Democratic camps
    - Polarisation a more recent phenomenon
  - Old cleavages do still exist however, and need an explanation of why their importance has declined
    - Postmaterialism – explains how people postwar were socialised
    - Parties don’t mobilise along ethnic or education lines in Western countries (except maybe US).
    - Class predicts socio-economic position, education predicts socio-cultural ones. Can talk about a liberal <-> authoritarian spectrum
  - Lots of social change: affluence, globalisation, secularisation
  - What effects does this have on party competition?
    - Multidimensional – adds a cultural axis e.g. importance of immigration, no longer just economic
    - Emergence of new parties
  - Dealignment not seen so much within younger / developing countries
- Top-down argument: party convergence means that people no longer engage in positional voting
  - Maybe they do valence voting
  - Or they might switch to other parties
  - Polarisation – you might think of this as a property of the party system
  - Debate between this and the bottom-up argument
- Do we see realignment?
  - Berglund – US vs Sweden and strength of party ID
  - If parties get more ideologically distant / partisan then you see greater party ID and so realignment
