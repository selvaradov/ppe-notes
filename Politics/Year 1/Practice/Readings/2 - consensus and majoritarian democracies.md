## Principles...
### Federalism (as opposed to unitary states)
- de jure vs de facto
- separate regional governments, protected in constitution
- regional and national governments independent (i.e. separately elected)
- constitutional separation of powers so different tiers of government have final authority in different policy areas; each tier directly governs citizens
- *devolution* is when the national government can unilaterally recall the granted powers
- *congruent* or *incongruent* (the latter when territorial units differ significantly in ethnicity/language from each other)
- *symmetric* or *asymmetric* (the latter when territorial units differ in how much power they each have)
- in structure (i.e. binary; if it's not unitary) and in practice (level of decentralisation)
- *coming-together* (bottom up; sovereign polities agree to give up powers) vs *holding-together* (top down; national government grants powers to subpolities to avoid secession)
- benefits
	- more likely to reflect citizens' preferences when your units of government are smaller
	- people can vote with their feet on economic policy so boosts growth & economy
	- regional level, so more responsive, better information passes from government to voters, etc. higher accountability
	- allows for policy experimentation & innovation
	- reduces risk of tyranny
- downsides
- government/policies get duplicated or contradict each other
- only weak incentives for regional governments to act in interests of the nation, e.g. spend beyond their means and hope for central govt bailout
- race to the bottom in taxes etc
- esp in asymmetric systems, more regional inequality & instability
- maybe undermines accountability as citizens don't know who is responsible (backed up by one study finding more corruption in more decentralised countries)
###  bicameralism vs unicameralism
- again, *congruent* vs *incongruent* (i.e. if political compositions differ because of how members are selected)
- *malapportionment* if some citizens get more representation than others, when upper chamber is used to represent each subnational unit equally
- *symmetric* or *asymmetric* in terms of how much power each chamber has
- bicameralism in federal states: territorial upper chamber
- bicameralism in unitary states: to improve quality of legislation and avoid bad decisions by lower chamber, so must be incongruent
### constitutionalism
- shift towards it over time
- more space for judges in legislative process
- *entrenched* - requires a special amendment process to be changed above just a legislative majority
- *legislative supremacy* (e.g. UK; unentrenched by definition) vs *higher law* (most other places; has judicial review & bill of rights)
- strategic incentives for courts - need support from voters, and voters must be able to understand legislative responses to judicial decisions in order to punish parties that ignore them
- types of constitutional review
	- abstract vs concrete (is there a particular case at hand or not)
	- a priori/posteriori (before or after law is enacted)
	- centralised (a single constitutional court) or decentralised (multiple courts can interpret constitution and works its way up to Supreme Court)
	- American vs European model (table 15.7)
### veto players
> an individual or collective actor whose agreement is necessary for a change in the political status quo *(page 718)*
- institutional: set out in constitution, e.g. US Senate, President, etc
- partisan: come about because of political outcomes, e.g. influential party in parliament
> countries in which there are many veto players with conflicting policy preferences are likely to be characterized by (a) greater policy stability, (b) smaller shifts in policy, (c) less variation in the size of policy shifts, and (d) weaker agenda-setting powers *(page 720)*
- *winset* of policy alternatives that would defeat status quo in pairwise contest under whatever voting rules being used (i.e. unanimity, since it's veto players)
	- larger winset leads to less policy stability and larger changes in policy, since more things are able to beat the status quo
	- also means the agenda setter is more powerful, because they can put the new proposal much nearer to their ideal when the winset is larger
- effects of more policy stability
	- lower governmental/regime stability in parl/pres systems
	- more judicial & bureaucratic activism
> we should probably use different criteria to evaluate majoritarian and consensus democracies, because their democratic visions and goals are not the same. *(page 759)*

- --> but we can use the actual desired outcomes to compare them, right - e.g. economic growth, etc.
### majoritarian and consensus
> Democracies in which power is concentrated are referred to as majoritarian democracies, whereas democracies in which power is dispersed are referred to as consensus democracies
- majoritarian
	- elections are competitions between parties and their manifestos, the winning one implements its programme
	- voters judge parties at each election but don't get involved with influencing policy between them
	- power is concentrated with the majority government; other actors/institutions aren't involved
- consensus
	- elections aren't a referendum on what policies to implement, but choose who agents to bargain over policy in the legislature
	- majorities in the legislature work on a policy-by-policy basis 
- Powell (2000): maybe majoritarian better when the issues at stake are simple and preferences clear, whereas consensus better when multidimensional and bargaining/compromise required

- election system influences type of party system (and vice versa)
	- Duverger's law: plurality voting (i.e. FPTP) leads to small party systems (i.e. only a few major parties?), whereas PR leads to large party systems (minor parties exist in government?)
- all linked together: more decentralised <-> more constitutional entrenchment <-> more bicameral <-> etc
- "majoritarian democracies value accountability and mandates over representation"
	- in consensus, it's harder to hold particular parties responsible, since there's loads of bargaining (lower *clarity of responsibility*)
	- also government might change due to coalition partners defecting etc, during inter-election periods; less *government identifiability* at election time
	- that also makes clarity of responsibility lower, because current govt might not have been in office for long by the time of next election
	- they argue that "clarity of responsibility is a necessary condition for accountability" which seems right
	- majoritarian is about prospective as well as retrospective voting - i.e. giving a mandate for their manifesto
	- pre-electoral coalitions help with government identifiability
	- *manufactured majorities* are the norm in majoritarian systems, i.e. unrepresentative electoral system translates non-majority support in population to majority seats in legislature
	- dynamic and static representation: responsiveness to changes in voters' views, and congruence with their views at a point in time
