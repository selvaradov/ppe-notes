## Tarrow (2022)
- definition of social movements:
> sequences of collective action based on underlying social networks, on resonant collective action frames, and on the capacity to sustain challenges against powerful opponents
- includes things like democracy movements in authoritarian regimes, environmental movements, anti-immigration, etc
- contentious collective action
> Collective action becomes contentious when it is used by people who lack regular access to representative institutions, who act in the name of new or unaccepted claims, and who behave in ways that fundamentally challenge others or authorities... It is the main and often the only recourse that most ordinary people possess against better-equipped opponents or powerful states
- emergence of social movements in 18th CE along with the modern state
- chapter 7 on why they get reformism instead
