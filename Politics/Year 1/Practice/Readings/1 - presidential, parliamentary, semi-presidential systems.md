## Samuels, separation of powers
- Shugart and Carey (1992) give three difference between presidentialism and parliamentarism
	1.  Separate origin and survival
	2. Constitutionally guaranteed executive authority to execute laws (i.e. the legislature makes laws but enactment/implementation must be done by/with the president)
	3. Chief executive control over parliament
- "Resoluteness" (sticking to policy) and "decisiveness" (making policy)
	- Presidential is more resolute and less decisive
	- Parliamentary executives always approve legislature's proposals more frequently than presidential executives
- Argues that ability to influence the cabinet is the most important power that presidents have over policy

## Principles of comparative...
- presidential system
- parliamentary system
- semi-presidential (hybrid) system
   - premier-presidential
   - president-parliamentary
- legislative responsibility
- constructive vote of no confidence
- govt initiated vote of confidence (tactical)
- trends in numbers of countries in each category

>A **presidential democracy** is one in which the  government does not depend on a legislative  majority to exist.
>A **parliamentary democracy** is one in which the government depends on a legislative majority to exist and the head of state is not popularly elected for a fixed term.
>A **semi-presidential democracy** is one in which the government depends on a legislative majority to exist and the head of state is popularly elected for a fixed term.

- ministerial responsibility
- collective cabinet responsibility
- investiture vote
- formateur and informateur
- office-seeking vs policy-seeking politicians
- Gamson's law (underrep of large parties, overrep of small)
- connected coalition
- minimal winning coalition; least MWC
- minority governments
  - the hypotheses for why they form (opposition strength, corporatist, investiture, strong party)
  - what they say about office vs policy seeking
  - who is in the implicit coalition
  - why would parties choose to not enter a government coalition
  1. avoid accountability
  2. keep pledges to not be in coalitions
  3. no past record so more flexible on next manifesto (kind of like 1.)
  - corporatist vs pluralist interest group relations (i.e. whether inside or outside formal policymaking process)
- surplus majority governments
	- also evidence of policy seeking above just office seeking
	- governments of national unity
	- supermajorities required (e.g. Belgium)
	- to prevent blackmail by small coalition partners/internal opponents
	- pre-electoral committments
> it takes, on average, about a month (29.9 days) for a government to form after an election in Western Europe.

- endogenous election timing 
	- making the most of a high
	- political business cycle (i.e. manipulating economy on purpose)
	- but if voters are clever, they'd realise that calling an early election is a signal that things are going to get worse (otherwise the gov't wouldn't have done so) 
	- hmm, but apparently evidence for the final one
- size of presidential cabinets vs parl ones
	- existence of minority governments, more common
	- coalition goverments less common
- key differences in government composition between presid and parl democ
	![[Pasted image 20240109133646.png]]
	- pres -> more non partisans, less proportional 
- semi-presidential
	- premier-presidential
	- president-parliamentary 
	 ![[Pasted image 20240110092047.png]]
- cohabitation
	- France from 1986
	- Ukraine power struggle 2007
- direct vs representative democracy
- agency loss & perfect agent
- selection vs screening (ex ante mechanisms)
- police patrols and fire alarms (ex post mechanisms)
> Modernization theory holds that as societies become more economically modernized, wealthier and more educated, their political institutions become increasingly liberal democratic
- legislative deadlock:
	- in a presidential democracy occurs when a legislative majority opposed to the president is large enough to pass bills in the legislature but not large enough to override a presidential veto.
