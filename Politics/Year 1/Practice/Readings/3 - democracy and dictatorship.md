## Principles
- are democracies richer?
	- Principles: property rights; incentives to consume vs invest; dictatorial autonomy
- Military, civilian, monarchical dictatorships
	- Within civilian group: *dominant-party* ("a single party dominates access to political office and control over policy") vs *personalistic* ("the leader, although often supported by a party or the military, retains personal control of policy decisions"; "it is typical for regime personnel to be rotated frequently at the whim of the leader to prevent them from building independent bases of support.")
- Dictator's dilemma: whether to allow free expression or to use repression
	- "Relies on repression to stay in power, but this repression creates incentives for everyone to lie so that the dictator never knows his true level of support in the country"
	- Quite an interesting account of why dictators would cultivate ridiculous cults of personality
		> “the dictator wants a credible signal of your support; merely staying silent and not saying anything negative won’t cut it. In order to be credible, the signal has to be costly: you have to be willing to say that the dictator is not merely OK, but a superhuman being, and you have to be willing to take some concrete actions showing your undying love for the leader.” As we noted in Chapter 8, these actions often include things like denouncing others who lack sufficient faith in the leader, and ostentatious displays of the dictator’s image or ideology.
- *electoral authoritarian regime*: there are elections and some pluralism/party competition (as opposed to *politically closed authoritarian regimes*), but democratic norms undermined to a great extent
	- *hegemonic* where leader's party wins overwhelming majorities, *competitive* where opposition groups win at least substantial minorities \[but of course this is down to subjective coding and classification rules]
	- Examples of hegemonic electoral regimes include Egypt, Singapore, Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Angola, and Uzbekistan in the 1990s.
	- but they argue that it is a second dimension of dictatorial regimes rather than a subcategory of the civilian regimes
- why might dictators hold elections?
	- a few reasons; pg373-4
	- different dictatorship types may use different electoral systems (monarchies more PR to ensure other potentially popular groups are divided and low in competing legitimacy; dominant-party chooses FPTP/majoritarian)
- regime longevity
	- military shortest, then personalistic, then dominant-party, then monarchy (pg377-8)
	- good policymaking does not necessarily correspond to regime longevity (p385)
> 	For example, BDM2S2 (2003, 273–276) provides both a list of the twenty-five “best” leaders in regard to their provision of peace and prosperity from 1955 to 2002 and a list of the top twenty-five longest-ruling leaders in the same period. There is no overlap between the leaders on the two lists.
- *selectorate theory* to explain this (p385)
	- "characterizes all governments by their location in a two-dimensional institutional space. One dimension is the size of the selectorate, and the second dimension is the size of the winning coalition"
	- disenfranchised: residents not allowed to participate in choosing the government
	- winning coalition: "those members of the selectorate whose support is necessary for the leader to remain in power"
		- typically smaller in dictatorships than in democracies
		![[Pasted image 20240123112926.png]]
	- "ratio of the size of the winning coalition to the size of the selectorate (W/S) represents the probability that a member of the selectorate will be in any winning coalition"
		- smaller W/S means a higher *loyalty norm* as members of the current winning coalition know that it's unlikely they'd be lucky enough to end up in another leader's winning coalition
		- more corruption and kleptocracy ("when corruption is organized by political leaders with the goal of personal enrichment") in regimes with higher loyalty norm
		- and this leads to underprovision of public goods/services

	 > The key factor that distinguishes democracies from dictatorships is the size of the winning coalition. Whereas all dictatorships have small winning coalitions, all democracies have large ones. And the key factor that distinguishes between the different types of dictatorship is the size of the selector ate. The selectorate is large in dominant-party and personalistic dictatorships, particularly those that hold elections. \[it's just that these elections are rigged, so you don't need the support of that many people to win]
	 
	- smaller winning coalition makes it more likely that support is won through provision of private goods
		- when W is very large it's not practical to bribe off each person individually
	- this explains empirical variation in performance of dictatorships
		- "dominant-party and personalistic dictatorship... are characterized by small winning coalitions and strong loyalty norms. On the other hand, monarchies and military juntas... are characterized by weak loyalty norms"
		- so the former produces the worst policy outcomes and the latter better ones
	- a large W, and large W/S system (like in democracies) will produce good policy outcomes
