## Clarke et al. (2004)
> Analyses endorse a valence politics model that challenges the long-dominant social class model. British voters make their choices by evaluating the performance of parties and party leaders in economic and other important policy areas.

### Chapter 1: Political Choice in Britain
- Main point - nowadays (=20 years ago!!) party support is much more complex & less neatly class-determined than in pre-1960s
> Indeed, in the 1970s, observers were already charting the decline of class voting and of party identification (or ‘partisanship’) in Britain. At the same time, other analysts were beginning to talk about the voter as consumer. Voters were appearing to become less tribal, and they were increasingly prepared to make choices between political parties based on the attractiveness of the alternative policy packages being offered.
- Turnout lower than it has been (though note that the 2001 election which they were writing in the wake of was an anomaly; [CBP-8060.pdf (parliament.uk)](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8060/CBP-8060.pdf) )
- "we see voters as making summary judgements based primarily on what he called ‘valence’—on their perceptions of the likely competence of competing parties' managerial teams."
- Two approaches: sociological and economic
- Sociological
	- Fixed social characteristics make people predisposed to one party or another
	- These effects can be reinforced or undone by the person's social context
	- People develop stable attachments to particular parties
	- Argued to be good at accounting for relative stability in UK electoral results - social factors change only very slowly as opposed to economics & specific party leaders, so makes sense why electoral outcomes haven't been that volatile
	- But, there's been a post-1960s decline in party ID (Crewe, Sarlvik, and Alt 1977) and no obviously corresponding social structure change
	- Also correlation between vote and social class has weakened (e.g. Franklin 1985; Rose and McAllister 1986)
	- Proponents of framework can give a more complex account of class which doesn't show this weakening in correlation (Heath, Jowell, and Curtice 1985, 2001), also looking at "class-related cleavages" e.g. private vs public sector worker
	- \[but I don't really understand why they can't move away from class and just say that other sociological things matter, e.g. whether you are a "somewhere" or an "anywhere", etc etc. does mention a focus on ideology & values (Rose and McAllister 1990; Heath et al. 1991, 1994; see also Scarbrough 1985). But it seems obvious that Labour is just no longer the "natural" working-class party because it's changed its offering to appeal to left-liberals, etc etc.]
- Individual rationality
	- Classic paper: "An Economic Theory of Democracy", Downs (1957), but the paradox of voting must mean that non purely self-interested benefits motivate people to turn out (Aldrich 1993)
	- People choose the party closest to them in (often 1-dimensional) policy space
	- Rational parties position themselves to maximise votes \[hmm, but they're not purely office-seeking]
	- "debate over whether voters are mainly egocentric or sociotropic, and prospective or retrospective, when forming their political judgements"
	- Can explain party ID in terms of rational choice - it's a shortcut to save computation cost of always re-evaluating each party every time \[this makes sense to me]
		-  "party identifcation is best seen as a running tally, or an accumulation, of voters' retrospective evaluations of the performance of major parties and their leaders" (Fiorina 1981)
	- Green and Shapiro 1994: critical review of rationality approach
	- Overall, approach apparently fails empirically unless you start including non-rational things which defeats the point
	- Stokes (1963, 1992) and position/valence competition (see [[6 - party systems]] readings!)
	- Also voters use mental shortcuts & heuristics when rationally evaluating parties
		- So, they argue that the two important ones for voter behaviour are evaluation of party leaders, and party ID (in the accumulating retrospectively, Fiorina perspective, rather than as fixed sociologically)
	- And you can use a wider set of reasons to explain why people still rationally vote, e.g. believing "that the legitimacy and successful functioning of the political system require widespread citizen participation"
		- \[yeah this is obvious??]
- British Election Study "was explicitly designed to test rival explanations of voter turnout and party choice"
- The "Downsian approach" is the one that voters choose positionally in issue space
- Party ID is given as an explanatory variable in both rational valence and sociological accounts
- But they say all three accounts are relevant to understanding voter choice
- "Party identifcation, leader images, issue positions and proximities, and economic evaluations all exerted sizeable effects on vote choice."
- "The decline in the role of class is not matched by a compensating rise in the explanatory power of other social location variables. This implies that the overall importance of the sociological approach has declined since 1964."
- "party identifcation is a powerful predictor of electoral preference. This was true in the 1960s and it remains true today."
- Chapter 6 looks at determinants of partisanship
	- "partisanship can be effectively modelled as a response to judgements about party leader performance and economic evaluations"
> These findings suggest that partisanship in Britain corresponds closely to the characterization provided by the valence politics model. Since the two other main predictors of vote choice—leader perceptions and economic evaluations—are also derived from the valence model, we conclude that electoral choice in Britain has been, and remains, primarily about valence.
- Then they look at models of voter turnout, do some statistical tests
- Finally satisfaction with democratic process, says current generation not very interested in politics or believing it's efficacious, but was exactly the same for previous generations
### Chapter 2: Theories and Models of Party Support
- Talks about what the sociological approach claims in more detail
	- "Characteristics-contexts approach" i.e. some fixed attributes plus the social environment the individual finds themself in
	- Social psychology i.e. their subjective partisan attitudes & party identification \[not really worded very comprehensibly and I don't understand how it's that different from first framing] 
		- Party ID acquired at a young age in families / adolescent social settings (Campbell et al. 1960; see also Butler and Stokes 1969; Jennings and Niemi 1974)
		- Stable and strengthens over an individual's lifetime (Converse 1969, 1976)
	- Party ID acts as a filter through which individuals respond to and interpret events, so has an additional influence due to this "perceptual screening"
		- Because it's stable and generational, anchors the wider party system (Stokes and Iversen 1966; Campbell et al. 1966)
	- Green, Palmquist, and Schickler (2002): party ID as to do with people expressing their own identity through << these are the groups I'm like socially >> -> << these are the parties that those groups support >>
		- "party ID is a socially informed self-identifcation with cognitive and affective components" - is this opposing the rationality account because it's saying it's about how people feel, etc? confused what they're actually disagreeing about...

> 	In the classic situation of two-party competition, the expectation is that parties converge on the policy position of the ‘median voter’ (Black 1958); that is, the person whose policy preference is at the mid-point of the distribution of policy preferences in the electorate. By converging on the position of the median voter, a party maximizes the number of votes it receives.

- \[this just seems not to be true, political parties are getting further apart!! isn't there something here about the ice cream sellers when it's a more complex scenario and the dominant strategy isn't to be in the centre? also parties (or maybe at least leaders) are policy-seeking]

- Individual rationality approach
	- Downs and his political issue space
	- p22 some stuff about the shortcuts voters might use when computing what maximise E(utility)
	- Stokes and valence competition
		- But both Stokes and Downs include importance of retrospective judgements in making future assessments
		- And also voters assign responsibility to current performance to incumbents in both models
		- "the incumbent wins votes when inflation or unemployment declines and ‘utility’ as measured by prosperity improves": Key's (1968) reward–punishment model
	- There are some other models, e.g. "issue-position" seems to be promoted by Stokes
	- "Issue-priority" model predicts that "negative outcomes do not necessarily prompt punishment \[for incumbent] at the polls"
		- because perhaps the incumbent has a record/reputation of caring a lot about outcomes in that particular area, and so voters want them to be in government to fix it
		- (e.g. when healthcare in crisis, maybe left-wing parties get higher support even if they were just in power when things went wrong, similarly with right-wing and immigration)
	- Economic evaluations - are voters egocentric or sociotropic
		- Are these past-oriented or future-oriented?
		- Downs (1957: 40) argues voters compare current circumstances with hypothetical if the other party had been in power, rather than comparing two hypotheticals about the different futures with each party in power
	- How does party ID develop
		- Key (1968: 298-9) talks about connection between policies and ID. Paraphrased as "either an identification develops first and the policy preference of the party is adopted next, or an initial preference leads to a subsequent identification" \[but this is such a vacuous statement!!]
		- Fiorina and ID as a running-tally: "Valence Issues and Retrospective Voting"
	- Importance of party leaders and the images they present
		- Presidentialization of position of PM; personalization of electoral politics with heavy focus on the leader's personality whilst on campaign trail 
		- Falling back onto the party leader is a useful cognitive trick \[all of this is kind of blatantly obvious and I'm confused why it's something that people write papers and papers about. I guess if they're doing empirical work to justify these stories then it is useful, but just telling the stories isn't that original imo]
		- Then do some stats and say that there are two main dimensions of assessing party leader image that voters use, competence and responsiveness
- Class in Britain
	- Given as the main sociological determinant by Butler and Stokes
	- It can explain outcomes in a given election, but since it's so stable, it can't really explain why there are big variations in party success between elections
		- Even demographic changes do not happen quickly enough to lead to short-term variation like we see in who wins elections
	- p33 other people's accounts of why class-vote is the most important thing
		- but also, evidence showing that class dealignment has been ongoing for some time \[and presumably continuing since 2004...]
	- Maybe New Labour's victory can be explained by the individual rationality & policy space account (Sanders 1998)
- Significant effects of economic conditions on how people vote
	- Essex Model: "macroeconomic conditions, particularly interest rates and taxation rates, strongly influence voters' expectations about their personal financial circumstances, and these expectations, in turn, propel the dynamics of governing party support (e.g. Sanders et al. 1987; Sanders 1991, 1993, 1995)"
	- Emotional reactions to economic conditions important p35
- Leaders matter too \[whoah really?!]
	- Miller et al. 1990; Stewart and Clarke 1992; Clarke, Stewart, and Whiteley 1997, 1998
- "The fundamental limitations of sociological models are their inability to deal with information that lacks an obvious social group referent, and their inability to keep pace with the short- and medium term changes in the variables they purport to explain (Dalton and Wattenberg 1993)"
### Chapter 6: Dynamics of Party Identification
- didn't read in full, but a lot of stats & analysis
	- rejects sociological party ID hypothesis
	- heuristics & shortcuts used by voters to make bounded rational assessments e.g. using party leaders
		- (mentions Simon 1957 paper introducing [bounded rationality]([Bounded Rationality (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/)))
- This is also an interesting point about whether voters really do have stable attachments or just an artifact of asking them which party they belong to
	- "The BSA (British Social Attitudes) surveys consistently reveal that large numbers of people do not think of themselves as party supporters. In 15 such surveys conducted between 1983 and 1999, the percentage stating that they are not party supporters ranges from a low of 49 per cent (1989, 1990) to a high of 61 per cent (1999), and it averages 54 per cent." p197
	- "One cannot use data generated by party supporter-type questions to portray partisan attachments as widespread, stable elements in the psychology of the British electorate. Rather, the overall impression conveyed by answers to party supporter questions is one of stable partisans, being the exception, not the rule."
> The analyses presented in this chapter are inconsistent with a sociological approach to party support. Rather, the evidence presented here speaks strongly on behalf of ‘valenced partisanship’ in the British electorate. By valenced partisanship, we mean that voters' party identifications can be thought of as a storehouse of accumulated party and party leader performance evaluations.
> ~ p211
### Chapter 7: Theories and Models of Turnout
- Tries to explain decline in turnout, especially as seen in 2001 election \[which with more data we can now say was an anomaly... An interesting exercise would be to use models from previous periods, see how well they work on future data, and then use this as a calibration tool for our current models. I wonder how commonly this is done.]
> The sociological framework includes three models—perceived equity fairness (or relative deprivation), social capital, and civic voluntarism. The individual rationality framework also has three models—cognitive mobilization, minimal rational choice, and general incentives.
- Democratic elitism vs participatory citizenship \[didn't understand what's being got at]
	- But they agree on what political participation is: when citizens express their beliefs/attitudes to public officials in an attempt to shape policy
- Different kinds of political participation; not just voting
	- "Verba and Nie (1972) pioneered this line of inquiry when they identified four basic types of participation—voting, campaign activity, contacting, and cooperative activity."
	- "in their 1984–5 study, Parry, Moyser, and Day (1992) sorted twenty-three activities along six dimensions" \[?!!]
- They hypothesise, based on some stats stuff, that there are four dimensions of political participation (p222)
	- Voting, party activity, protest, community activity
	- "The voting and protest factors are essentially unrelated (0.06)"
	- "The community activity and protest factors have a statistically significant and very strong correlation (0.85)."
- Sociological framework
	- *Perceived equity–fairness model*
		- People who think they're treated less fairly than their expectations say they should be get angry
		- They might protest or they might withdraw from the system, it depends on who they attribute responsibility to \[and of course that is beyond the scope of this model...]
		- "relative deprivation is a potential source of nonvoting" \[whoah]
		- \[this is so vague & vacuous arghhhhh]
		- You can operationalise disadvantage by employment status, gender, ethnic minority, etc
	- *Social capital model*
		- Higher social capital <-> more trust between citizens
		- And people trust institutions to be beneficial for them
		- So they participate in them
		- \[wait but you can just reverse this argument and it sounds roughly as plausible - people trust institutions to be beneficial for them so they don't need to participate and engage, because everything will be all ok]
		- "People who trust their fellow citizens volunteer more often, contribute more to charity, participate more often in politics and community organizations, serve more readily on juries, give blood more frequently, comply more fully with their tax obligations, are more tolerant of minority views, and display many other forms of civic virtue" (Putnam 2000: 137).
	- *Civic voluntarism model*
		- Some people acquire politically relevant skills by taking part in community activities, and then they participate in politics because of getting these resources
		- "a three-fold account of why people do not vote: ‘because they can't; because they don't want to; or because nobody asked’ (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995: 15)."
		- So links to social class & education level, and also "political interest and strength of partisanship" \[but this is exactly what you are trying to explain!!! ugh]
- Individual rationality framework
	- The calculus of voting -- basically just expected utility. From Downs 1957
		- pivotality (i.e. probability of casting decisive vote),
		- benefits (i.e. absolute benefit of result going one way over the other),
		- costs (time)
	- Riker and Ordeshook (1973: 63) explicitly on irrationality of voting
	- *Cognitive mobilization model*
		- More politically aware people are more likely to be dissatisfied with political outcomes \[hmm maybe they're more likely to have stronger political views, but why in the negative direction? I guess maybe something about the distance between their ideal and the status quo is likely to be larger]
		- Dissatisfied people protest but again the theory can't decide if they'll end up voting for the opposition or "withdrawing from political arena"
		- Apparently core concepts are "education, media use, political interest, political knowledge, and policy (dis)satisfaction" but I fail to see how this is significantly different from e.g. civic voluntarism in terms of what it predicts. Maybe according to civic voluntarism people vote even if they're very satisfied with the current party and this is the main difference??
	- *Minimal rational choice model*
		- something about people feeling able to exert political influence, idk
	- *General incentives model*
		- again tries to explain paradox of voting
		- Uses some Olson selective incentives (see [[5 - social movements]]) 
		- There are individual, group, system, and expressive benefits which get added in to the expected utility of voting calculation and then make it net positive
		- Not clear to me in what way expressive and individual are different, if they're both about private senses of reward.
		> Individual benefits refer to one's sense of personal or private reward that comes from voting. Group benefits go to  people who are seen as similar to oneself or in need of a ‘helping hand’. System benefits \[to do with idea that]... a healthy democracy requires citizen involvement. Expressive benefits... are the sense of satisfaction that people receive when they demonstrate their support for political actors, institutions, or processes.
- End up concluding that sociological aspects only tell part of the story, typical problems with direction of causality, and other stuff
- Chapter 8 looks at which one empirically is best, but don't think this is relevant
	- (from the abstract, apparently general incentives model performs best.
	> By a slim margin, the general incentives model also does best in terms of correctly classifying voters and non-voters. It is closely followed by the cognitive mobilization and civic voluntarism models. By all of the criteria presented in the table, the social capital and equity–fairness models are inferior to their rivals

## Van der Eijk
- Younger voters are more malleable, those with established partisanship are harder to convert to another party
	- How true is this? i.e. to what extent do voters actually have stable attachments
	- This was why Lipset & Rokkan have their argument about freezing following 1920s universal suffrage: no longer new groups of malleable voters
		- interesting point wrt Roosevelt and New Deal - perhaps he succeeded by managing to get people who previously weren't politically active to vote for him, rather than actively persuading others to switch to supporting him (p184 but also apparently this is a disputed account)
- "Decade of Dealignment" (1983) an important book
	- Figure 7.1, a "clear decline" in number of partisans over time
	- Age difference is the important thing here. Old voters are no less partisan than they were; but young voters are much less partisan
	- \[what does being a "strong partisan" mean at the object level?]
- Generational replacement can account for some variation in electoral success
	- But Eijek and Niemoller (1983) found that in NL, voters switching parties caused 3x as much political volatility as generational factors
- Key claimed that there had to be first dealignment and then realignment but apparently not really any evidence for this
- Decline in cleavage-based politics means that young voters are more floating & open to persuasion than in the past
- p188 - mentions case studies of times where older voters with supposedly stable attachments have switched parties because the one they supported "really disappoints them"
	- \[OK, so now he is basically just conceding people only keep their stable attachments because they're happy with the results those parties are delivering...]
- p190 - effects of expanding franchise and compulsory voting
	- When franchise expanded to a new group for the first time, many of them lack the habit of voting and so turnout at a rate lower than the rest of the population
	- also some other theorised stuff about effect of removing compulsory voting from Franklin 2004 but not sure why care
	- the model does seem to do a good job of predicting actual outcomes though, see Fig 7.5 p192
- Box 7.2 p196 - overlapping preferences of voters
	- fully 28% of those who were in Labour's potential electorate said that they would also consider voting for the Conservatives
- p198 a good point about an asymmetry in terms of fulfilling electoral potential which is basically mean reversion argument
	- Ruling parties are ones who have captured most of their potential electorate
	- Good economic performance etc can't help them very much, because they don't have a lot of space to add more voters in the short term without generational changes (according to view that a substantial proportion of voters are sticky to parties)
	- But bad performance can definitely hurt them, because their floating voters will leave
- **Apparently bottom row of Fig 1.2 and Chapter 4 (p110) talks about factors affecting preferences**
- Talks about the priority model too, p207
- p209 - claims a lack of stable attachments in developing democracies
	- because parties change their ideological positions a lot in response to social changes, so voters don't know which party to attach themselves to
	- could bring this in, maybe I take the line that stable attachments are a shortcut but in new democracies it's not an effective shortcut so people don't use it
- "voters are voters wherever you find them"; people are just responding to different political environments
## Political Parties and Partisanship (ed. Bartle & Bellucci)
### Chapter 3 - party ID revisited

- in European countries very party-centred (as opposed to candidate centred) so party ID virtually indistinguishable from voting choice.
	- Think they use this to argue party ID isn’t a useful thing to measure. But it does tell us that weaker party ID might lead to less stable voting?
- One interesting point that in NL, reported party ID is **less stable** than voting choice. 
	- Possibly due to strategic voting – “voters whose party identification shifts between a small and a large party in the same region of the ideological spectrum may in both instances prefer to vote for the same large party.
- Also the 1976 paper by Thomassen says that “There is strong evidence that party identification is not causally prior to the vote”

### Chapter 5 – partisanship in nine Western countries

- “Party identification… is certainly a less stable and enduring phenomenon than it was originally conceived (Campbell et al. 1960). Not only does it respond to political and economic stimuli (Page and Jones 1979; Fiorina 1981; Franklin and Jackson 1983; MacKuen et al. 1989), it also reacts strongly to the style of electoral competition as defined by the electoral system in use. Its effects on vote choices, by contrast, seem to be mostly a function of the politicization of social divisions and react only indirectly to the style and intensity of electoral competition.”
- Interesting finding that “style of political competition” (i.e. plurality or proportional voting) is the variable with largest effect on level of partisanship (although not on the partisan vote). So plurality system -> more partisanship.
- Only a small effect from ideological distance between parties on partisanship. Maybe this can support the valence competition theory?
### Chapter 7 – individual and contextual origins of durable partisanship
- “After all, respondents were asked 20 times on an annual basis which party they support and about half never named any other party than the one they already supported during their youth on any of these occasions.”
- A very nice argument in the conclusion that perhaps less sophisticated citizens are more likely to just inherit party ID from parents and more sophisticated ones do act like Fiorina’s Bayesian-ish model says. See Bartels et al. ("Heterogeneity, state dependence, and the dynamics of individual-level party identification" 2005) and Green et al. ("Partisan Hearts and Minds: Political Parties and the Social Identities of Voters" 2002) 
	- \[we can explain this all within bounded rationality I think]
- Empirically they find systematic differences in durability of partisanship between individuals which fits this prediction. West Germany more durable than East perhaps because in East more political mobilisation pre-unification.
- “Supporting the expectations from different theoretical approaches, we find the most durable partisanships in our sample amongst politically unsophisticated West Germans whose partisanship apparently originates in parental socialization.”
