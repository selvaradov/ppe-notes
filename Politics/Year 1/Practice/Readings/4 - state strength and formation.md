## Principles
- predatory model and contractarian model (see below)
	- the former is descriptive, latter more normative about what the duties of citizens are to the state, etc
	- predatory model views rulers as egoistic, maximizing, rational actors; can explain why some rulers share power or limit their extractive activity whereas others do not; shows how the institutional environment and leaders' actions interact with each other (e.g. political units grow to take advantage of economies of scale in violence)

- Failed state - "a state-like entity that cannot coerce and is unable to successfully control the inhabitants of a given territory."
- Contractarian \[manages disputes between citizens but creates a new powerful agent which could abuse that strength] vs predatory \[extort citizens somehow??] view

- A nation vs a state
	- Nation is a group of people with a shared identity (can include stateless people e.g. Kurds, or diaspora, e.g. Roma)
	- State is a community that, according to Weber, "(successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory"
		- But when is use "legitimate"? Policing of civil rights protestors in the 1960s US is arguably not. \[yeah, it's legitimate because the state says it is, and maybe because the people generally consent to it? but this is a hard point to define; apparently most authors drop it from their definitions]
		- also, do they need to have a monopoly on it? what about when there are nonstate actors like the IRA, ISIS, etc.
		- there are other definitions, but they all still requrie the threat of violence and control over a given territory. e.g. "A state is an organization with a comparative advantage in violence, extending over a geographic area whose boundaries are determined by its power to tax constituents." (Douglass North)
- failed states fail because they cease to meet the definition of statehood; they're no longer able to coerce their population with the threat of violence
	- Somalia as an extreme example (lots and lots of invasions by neighbouring states & US/Soviet proxy warring, different tribes arguing, etc)
	- Failed States Index
	- Samuel P. Huntington: “the most important political distinction among countries concerns not their form of government but their degree of government"
### contractarian view (i.e. social contract)
- Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau
	- the state of nature, game theory & defection as Nash Eq
	- Garrett Hardin & evolutionary psych: if we rely on morals alone do incentivise good behaviour, then all the people with good morals will die out since people defect against them, and then morality disappears from the population 
	- "individuals... give up their natural rights (rights given to them by nature) in exchange for civil rights (rights given to them by laws) that would be protected by the sovereign."
	- Hobbes and the all-powerful sovereign; Locke/Rousseau thought people could keep some of the state of nature & cooperate within it, and delegate only some enforcement responsibilities to the sovereign
- but why would anyone want to be the sovereign?
	- They have to be compensated by their work in enforcement by taxes from citizens
	- Monetary, but also adherence to required customs like wearing a burqa, going to church, etc
### predatory view
- focusses on tension between interests of the state and interests of the citizens
- Charles Tilly - states are a form of extortion (the state demands payment from citizens so the citizens can avoid being punished by that very same state)
- pg 116 - developments in early modern European technology increased economies of scale of violence (since they raised fixed costs as e.g. siege fortifications etc were required)
	- marginal product of labour fell and land became relatively more valuable
	- so competition over land resources --> investment into war-making capacity
	- rulers needed to acquire other resources from their populations by using threat of violence \[why did technology change this?]
- pg 118, Jeffrey Herbst and arguments about rough geography leading to less development of states in sub-Saharan AFrica
	- costs of establishing a state not worth it
## Olson
### roving bandits vs stationary bandits
- stationary bandit monopolises theft in his domain, and takes a regular fixed proportion of residents' income
- this is great, "bandit rationality"
- basically, switching to a stationary bandit makes everyone better off, as "in a world of roving banditry there is little or no incentive for anyone to produce or accumulate anything that may be stolen and, thus, little for bandits to steal"
- the stationary bandits provide public goods insofar as they increase output, since the bandits get a fraction of that output
- \[we can link this to the W/S model somehow]
- presenting a predatory model of the state - the stationary bandits appear because of the rational decision-making of the best bandits, not due to some social contract
	- but doesn't like the term "predatory" as even dictatorships provide benefits to the people of stability and some public goods, out of self-interest
	- "the stationary bandit's incentive to provide public goods at the same time that he extracts the largest possible net surplus for himself"
- reinforces the point that the stationary bandit is like a monopolist over everything and charges monopolist prices
	- so obviously the tax rates are not such that they maximise social welfare, but there is perhaps more public goods provision than under anarchy
	- talks about purchase of public goods by the dictator in terms of upto where MC = MR for them ("MR" as it boosts the tax take to provide public goods)
### dynasties
- interesting point about dynasties in autocracies
	- lengthen time horizon of dictator so that they don't just appropriate subjects' property if it won't yield them more tax than their capital value in the length of their term, but rather leave them to generate more income in the long run
	- "Given autocracy, then, dynastic succession can be socially desirable, both because it may reduce the likelihood of succession crises and because it may give monarchs more concern for the long run and the productivity of their societies."
- citizens in democracies need assurance that the state will not just confiscate their property
	- this is what courts, and free speech, and respect for rights is necessary for
	- lasting democracy as providing stability 
### democracies
- elected democratic governments can be thought of as buying votes from a bare majority to win power
	- so they transfer money from the rest of the population to that majority
	- however, that majority will choose to set the tax rate lower than the autocrat would, because ?
- why do democracies spread?
	- setting aside the exogenous cases where a democracy defeats a dictatorship in battle and imposes it on them
	- theoretically, we expect democracies to form "when the individual(s) who orchestrated the overthrow of an autocracy could not establish another autocracy, much as they would gain from doing so"
	- i.e. dispersions of power which prevent one group/person accumulating it all, which are strongly contingent on history/geography -- and something preventing small-scale autocracy taking hold, e.g. different groups of inhabitants are thoroughly mixed
	- English post-Civil War democracy as an example of this (but N=1)
- "democracies have the great advantage of preventing significant extraction of social surplus by their leaders"
## Bates
- state failure =/= authoritarianism
	- yes, the state becomes an extractive "instrument of predation" in both
	- but in state failure there is also a loss of monopoly over coercion
- also not the same as revolution, which creates temporary violence en route to a new order
- Sierra Leone as an example, also Somalia, Afghanistan
	- in total make up <10% of global number of states
- we know a lot about causes of civil wars but less about state failure
	- since the two are closely associated, we can look at civil war to infer stuff about state failure
- three causes of state failure: economic, ethnic, democratisation
- argues political causes are the best predictors of state failure, not economic ones (Goldstone et al 2013)
	- causes are internal - e.g. regional divisions, religion, etc. So national-level data doesn't give a helpful picture, he argues
	- likes the quasi-experimental designs etc etc, use of sub-national data
### economic
- low per-capita income -> more civil war; lower life expectancy -> more state failure
	- why? maybe because it's cheaper to buy off people into joining armed groups
- "when per capita income and civil war were entered in equations that included country specific fixed effects, no relationship could be found"
	- I think the point here is that institutions and geography/history particular to a country are important and once you account for these there's no residual that per-capita GDP helps explain
	- i.e. the fact that we find the relationship in the naive case is because GDP is acting to approximate state capacity
- poverty of the state rather than poverty of citizens who get bribed into rebellion groups
	- i.e. state doesn't pay its civil servants or soldiers enough so they defect with corruption/extortion
	- but this is basically the same thing from an incentives point of view
	- the point is that it shows how the state (encompassing its employees) become predatory
- natural resources
	- oil seems to have most robust correlation with insurrection, effect of other natural resources disputed
	- "rentier state" in Middle East - the government gets lots of petrodollars, it doesn't depend on tax revenue from citizens, and can act in a repressive way
### ethnic
- a bunch of studies fail to find relationships between ethnic polarisation and state failure, some other studies do
	- story would be that either you get a weak state with underprovision of public goods because people can't agree on compromises, or an oversized one which doesn't have enough funding and becomes predatory
- maybe there are relationships between ethnic concentration and civil war (in particular duration), maybe not
	- story is that if one group dominates it can privatise the state and make it predatory on the smaller ones (but presumably the others need to be large enough that they fight back)
- minority rulers
	- use repression to prevent fellow members of the minority ruling group from defecting and starting an uprising
		- because if one of the current-elites did defect, then probably the population would hate them anyway for being complicit in the current repression, so it makes defection risky and costly for the current-elites
	- a similar point to the Olson that minority rulers will set higher taxes than a majority, because they transfer wealth to themselves from the whole population being taxed
	- confused by how to interpret the data in Table 2
### democratisation
- if you look at Polity, state failure & civil wars most common in intermediate countries
	- i.e. not in pure authoritarian or democracy
	- \[couldn't this just be because these countries are in transitory periods, etc? though Levitsky does argue against that in "hybrid regimes" etc etc]
	- aha ok points out that these intermediate democracies are very young, but relationship persists even after controlling for that
- low-income democracies much more likely to experience civil war than high-income ones, but no difference when comparing poor & rich autocracies
	- \[what theory does this support/oppose?]
	- ==> being democratic but underdeveloped seems especially dangerous
	- transition to democracy can maybe provoke state failure, study in Africa (Bates 2008); this guy likes to cite his own work a lot
## Spruyt (2009)
### intro
- accounts of the state e.g. Weber and monopolies on violence
- three parts to state formation, have to study them together
	- rule of law & efficient administration
	- ability to raise revenue/"extractive capacity"
	- legitimacy of state power
- "from purely a territorial perspective, states preceded nations and high‐capacity modern administrations by several centuries"
	- is this using the same definition of state vs nation (a people) that Clark et al. do?
	- anyhow, emphasis on territorial boundaries as important to statehood
- says we should focus on European state formation as the prototype
	- European view of the state was spread around the world
	- state formation in other countries affected by external forces
	- happened much faster than it would've done otherwise
- argues Europe is a useful model for testing causality for state formation in general
- "The manner in which non‐European regions diverged from the European experience profoundly affects their contemporary status as effective or failed states, and the likelihood that democratic transitions will be successful."
### causal dynamics
- war making
	- shift from heavy cavalry and a small elite cadre of knights to massed troops with standing armies; gunpowder meant heavier fortifications needed;
	- in general - greater fixed costs
	- developments in military technology -> more centralisation & state revenue needed
	- Tilly, state as a racketeer selling protection in exchange for tax
	- economies of scale in providing protection from rivals meant that kings grew in power relative to lords
	- criticisms:
		-  Tilly's account doesn't explain why kings' dynasties were relatively stable. why didn't other warlords become the king? 
		- also there was some development of states before the advances in military tech
		- some other economicsy point about capital vs labour that wasn't well-explained
- economic changes
	- erosion of feudalism, growth of burghers i.e. bourgeoisie / merchants
	- neo-Marxists: state grew to mediate class tensions between merchant towns and peasants
	- neo-institutionalists: more contractarian
		- kings wanted to increase their tax take by creating standards and monetising the economy (rather than barter-based)
		- merchants wanted military protection and economies of scale meant the king could provide this to them the cheapest
		- labour supply shocks led to incentive for elites to develop technology, and shift away from feudalist agriculture
- ideology
	- stalemate in power struggle between the Pope and emperors
### regime type
- lots of military conflict will lead to more authoritarian government
	- since state has to mobilise a lot, it will have a large presence in society
	- standing army can be used for internal repression as well as external defence
	- naval powers like Britain the internal repression capability is lower, so more likely to have state taxation by consent rather than coercion
- other sources of wealth e.g. colonies, and defensive features like mountains mean state has less of a need to be authoritarian in order to protect itself
	- so constitutional government more likely to form
- other stuff about strength of local assemblies
- neo-institutionalists: maybe democratic regimes lead to better outcomes (i.e. other direction of causality)
	- agreements the government makes with international allies are more credible because it is less able to suddenly renege on them
	- also constitutions mean that merchants etc are more confident that their wealth will not suddenly be expropriated, so they have a greater incentive to innovate and grow the economy (similar point in Olson, I think)
### modern state formation
- some more stuff but all looks very qualitative and historical
### Acemoglu
- investigates what is the effect of institutions on economic performance by looking at mortality of European sailors/traders there
- Hypothesis: settler mortality -> European settlement -> historical institutions -> current institutions -> current economic performance
	- where Europeans couldn't settle, they established extractive states with worse institutions
- Is it that settler mortality was affected by dangerous diseases which are still present and directly harming those current countries' economic performance
	- probably not; these diseases don't affect indigenous people that much and their mortality rates from them are low
- expropriation risk is used as proxy for institution quality
	- they say it's part of a cluster of other things like judiciary, property rights, education, etc which are related to each other
- spend time fleshing out their hypothesis and presenting results
- very strong correlation between institutions and economic performance
	- not necessarily causal
	- maybe rich countries can afford / fulfill their preference for better institutions
	- omitted confounder variables
	- maybe coders are biased against institutions in poorer countries and see them as worse than they really are
- lots of data and robustness checks
- conclusion:
> There is a high correlation between mortality rates faced by soldiers, bishops, and sailors in the colonies and European settlements; between European settlements and early measures of institutions; and between early institutions and institutions today. We estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita using this source of variation. We also document that this relationship is not driven by outliers, and is robust to controlling for latitude, climate, current disease environment, religion, natural resources, soil quality, ethnolinguistic fragmentation, and current racial composition.
