## Overview of concept...
- Populism as about dividing up society into "bad" establishment and "good" people whose general will ought to be implemented
- Also involving a charismatic leader, authoritarian tendencies
- There have been several left-wing populists in LatAm (e.g. Chávez, Morales, etc)
- Whereas in Europe, more right-wing
	- 2000: Austrian Freedom Party in coalition with mainstream Christian Democrats
- The US maybe the originator of populism
	- People's Party in 1890s
	- Tea Party
- Conceptualisations
	- Ideational
	- Political-strategic
	- Socio-cultural
	- Economic
		- Dornbusch and Edwards: idea that populism "emphasizes growth and income distribution and deemphasizes the risks of inflation and deficit finance"
		- Acemoglu et al call it "the implementation of policies receiving support from a significant fraction of the population, but ultimately hurting the economic interests of this majority"
		- But they don't like this view, can't accommodate right-wing exclusionary populism
## Very Short Introduction
### What is it?
- "People" vs "elite"
- They say "most fundamentally juxtaposed to liberal democracy" than any other kind of democracy
	- Empirically, most populists are to be found within liberal democratic systems
- Regional differences in what populism focuses on
	- Europe: xenophobia and anti-immigration
	- Latin America: economic mismanagement, clientelism
- They use the ideational \[still don't know what it is...] 
- Other approaches:
	- Popular agency i.e. about mobilisation of the people, so includes all mass movements
		- Critical studies (Laclauan) - populism leads to radical democracy which emancipates people and solves the problems of liberal democracy \[??]
		- Economic approach, except that lots of 1990s LatAm populists used neoliberal policies, rather than irresponsible inflationary ones
		- Political strategy, emphasis on the charismatic leader who has a direct connection with the masses
		- "Folkloric" \[??] where populist politicians break norms in order to get as much attention from the media as possible and show how they're different from the elites
- The ideational approach: populism as "a discourse, an ideology, or a worldview"
- Says that populism is
> a thin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic camps, “the pure people” versus “the corrupt elite,” and which argues that politics should be an expression of the *volonté générale* of the people
- The "thinness" of it is in contrast to e.g. socialism, fascism, liberalism which have a fuller set of views about how to organise society & what policies to implement etc
	- Populism is more like a frame which has to get combined with other ideologies - so it can be interpreted in different ways according to the society it's adopted in
	- "populism seldom exists in pure form. Rather, it appears in combination with, and manages to survive thanks to, other concepts"
- How do we compare populism with non-populism?
	- There's elitism, which just says that the elites are good and the masses bad
	- And there's pluralism, which says society is divided up into lots of overlapping groups, and power should be distributed so that no single group can impose itself on the others
	- Clientelism is a political strategy which may be used by populists but it's not an ideology, and politicians with different worldviews may also employ it
- What are "the people"?
	- It's a vague term, gets used rhetorically
	- The people as sovereign and the source of state legitimacy/power
	- "Common people" i.e. focussing on those who are otherwise economically/socially marginalised
	- The nation as a whole, although often within one state this comprises multiple ethnic groups
- And the evil elites - above all, they are characterised by populism in moral terms
	- The establishment, which intervenes to weaken the links between the people and its populist leaders
		- Has power e.g. in the media, arts, running the economy
	- Can populists hold power? Since wouldn't that make them part of the elite
		- They often redefine the elite by appealing to shadowy deep state forces that are holding the "real power" and getting in the way of the elected leaders
		- Hofstadter: "the paranoid style of politics"
	- Political elites on the side of economic elites, and so in thrall to special interests rather than the general will
		-  When President, Chávez claimed that even though he had political power the economic elites were scuppering his programme of government and that was the real reason why he wasn't having any success
	- Maybe the elites are also siding with the USA against their own country, or agents of Zionism, etc etc
	- In LatAm countries, where the elites are disproportionately of European descent, populists can also play into this by arguing that they're not the true people of the nation, etc etc
	- In Europe, claim is more that the elites are favouring the _interests_ of alien people, rather than that they are themselves aliens
- Rousseauian view of the general will
	- They think politicians ought to identify and implement it
	- _volonté générale_ as opposed to _volonté de tous_ 
		- The former is about people joining together to legislate in their common interest, the latter is just the sum of interests at a particular point in time \[?]
	- Populists are suspicious of representative government
		- The people are too passive and not involved properly
		- Prefer Rousseau's version of self-government where the citizens themselves vote on & make the laws
	- So populism can be seen as a democratising force
		- It will tend to promote institutions which help the general will to be taken into account in policymaking
- Authoritarian tendencies
	- Oppression of individuals who are perceived as threatening the homogeneity/unity of the people
- "populism is both a friend _and_ a foe of (liberal) democracy, depending on the stage of the process of democratization"
- Can look at the demand side and the supply side of populist ideas
### Around the world
- A modern phenomenon (from 19th CE)
- Found everywhere, but especially in Americas and Europe \[as an act of rebellion against democracy? / something only possible where we have democracy?]
- Very heterogenous
	- Again, thin-centred. Left-wingers combine with socialism, right-wingers combine with nationalism
- But you do get regional waves of populists with similar characteristics
	- e.g. left-wing socialists in LatAm; right-wing nativists in Europe 
#### North America
- Prairie populism in late 19th to early 20th CE
	- Poorly organised, regionalised
		- Had some successes at state legislature level
		- But People's Party didn't have a unified national candidate for presidential elections etc
	- Prompted by negative effects of industrialisation on rural frontier folk
	- "People" = yeomen farmers; "elites" = bankers etc in New England
		- Mostly a geographic/economic & moral distinction than ethnic/religious
- Returned in anti-communist early Cold War era
	- Again pretty geographic (heartlands vs northeastern New Englanders)
	- But this time the elites were bad for being un-American and harbouring socialist tendencies
- Faded post-McCarthy era in 1970s.
	- but Nixon tapped into the sentiment with "silent majority" etc
- 1968: former Democrat governor of Alabama ran for President with American Independent Party
	- Single-issue pro-segregation ticket
	- Got 10mn votes; 13.5%
- 1992: a Texan rightwinger, Ross Perot
	- 20mn votes
	- Another geographic populist, heartlands vs East Coast, pro gun rights, anti-budget deficit, etc
- The view of "the people" has changed little over time
- But the "elites" are defined less economically (i.e. not so much bankers & businessmen) than socio-culturally (Ivy League educated liberals etc)
- Post-financial crisis, new movements
	- Occupy Wall St - inclusionary, left-wing; social justice mass movement
	- Tea Party - exclusionary, right-wing
		- Combination of well-funded libertarians who're close to Republican establishment, and then smaller grassroots groups of regionally-organised activists
#### LatAm
- "the region with the most enduring and prevalent populist tradition"
	- fairly long democratic history, plus very high economic inequality
	- so people elect politicians promising to change things
- *pueblo* vs corrupt *oligarquía*
- First wave from 1929 Great Depression to 1960s
	- industrialisation & urbanisation --> demands for political & social rights
	- in some countries populism was more successful than socialism/communism \[since "the people" are numerically mostly working class anyway, what's the difference between appealing to the former as opposed to the latter as communism would?]
	- strongly anti-imperialist; racial elements too against the European elites
- Second wave in 1990s following economic crises across region
	- These ones were the neoliberal populists
	- e.g. worked with IMF on reforms to reduce inflation and stabilise debt
		- changes were not popular but were successful \[just in short term? or long also?]
	- this time the corrupt elites were the political class opposed to shrinking the state, rather than Europeans or other non-indigenous people
	- implemented anti-poverty programmes, etc
	- \[I don't get what in practice it means when you say that "the people were portrayed as a passive mass of individuals, whose ideas could be deduced from opinion polls". Surely politicians don't *say* to voters that they're passive, and also surely first wave populists would've paid attention to what the people were saying via data (if that data existed, which I suspect maybe it didn't)]
- Third wave started by Chávez in Venezuela (1998 election victory)
	- Similarities with first wave
	- _Americanismo_ and anti-imperialist rhetoric
	- but more partisan and overtly socialist than the first wave, which apparently tried to transcend left/right divide \[again, what does this mean _in practice??_ politicians in the first wave would've had to choose some kind of economic policy to implement, and so on]
		- has an inclusionary concept of the people - anyone who's excluded/discriminated against
	- A response to the fact that 1980s neoliberalism hadn't really reduced inequality, even if it did work at a macro level
	- drew up new constitutions to remove the previous political elites from power and also conveniently make it harder for their current opponents to compete in elections
#### Europe
- pretty minimal populist presence in 20th CE
- early agrarian movement started in Russia (_narodniki_) at end of 19th CE, but was small and mostly had urban intellectuals rather than actual broad-based support
	- "Go to the People" movement mostly brushed off by the peasants they were trying to recruit
	- someone in "People's Will"  group assassinated Tsar Alexander II and then they lost support
- Argues fascism and communism both ultimately elitist
	- exaltation of the leader in Fascism, plus the race and the state \[but how are the latter two elitist? Ideas about the _Volk_ seem to me to be pretty populist, especially when gesturing to claimed Jewish elites etc who are supposedly interfering in the state]
	- vanguard in Communism an elite group.
		- "the fundamental ideas of  “class struggle” and, particularly, “false conscienceless” are antithetical to populism" \[why??]
- So in the decades post-WW2, there was very little populism in Europe
	- Liberal democracy in West, centralised Communism in East
- 1956 - _poujadism_ in France had some success
- late 1990s - populism returns, with right-wing flavour
	- anti-immigration plus authoritarian "law & order" focus
	- welfare state for the native people first, etc etc
- \[UKIP is a "neoliberal" party?? hmm]
	- producerism: the elites (political establishment & trade unions) have saddled the working people with silly red tape and high taxes, and are overly rewarding pampered public-sector employees & immigrants
- In Hungary and Poland, Fidesz & PiS say a "real" revolution is needed because the current democratic elites are in cahoots with the Communist ex-leaders
- Emergence of some radical left populism post-2008
	- Euroskeptic but for different reasons, e.g. anti-austerity which they see as forced onto national governments by IMF, ECB, European Commission
#### Elsewhere
- Rightwing populists in Aus/NZ
	- New Zealand First - anti-immigration & protectionist but mostly supported but elderly Maori people
	- One Nation (Aus) - very anti-indigenous people and pro-white settlers
- Southeast Asia - flashes of populism after 1997 economic crisis but not long-lasting
- Little populism in Africa, mostly just authoritarian leaders
- Middle East
	- Populist rhetoric used in Arab Spring \[but why "not populist per se"?]
	- Erdogan & Netanyahu both populists
### Mobilisation
- Usually but not always linked to a charismatic leader
- Three types of mobilisation: personalist leadership, social movement, and political party
- "presidential systems strengthen personalist leadership, while parliamentary systems incentivize the emergence of political parties"
	- One reason for the difference we see between LatAm and Europe
- But also, populist social movements (like other social movements) more likely to emerge in countries with restrictive political opportunity structures
	- i.e. majoritarian system, high barriers to entry as a new party, etc
	- so populists can only really function as social movements
- Top-down mobilisation from a charismatic leader can lead to electoral breakthrough i.e. winning some seats in legislature, but harder to turn into sustained success
	- Normally these leaders are not very good at building the apparatus needed to win elections consistently
- Populist social movements can be very influential when they build a new political party or take over an existing one
	- When they stand on their own, less effective at helping populist politicians be elected
#### Personalist leadership
- Top-down mobilisation, on basis of the appeal of the leader as an individual
- Sometimes build a pseudo-party around them in order to organise to contest elections
	- But the party as a structure does not have any actual power; fully controlled by the leader
	- It's a "personalist electoral vehicle"
- Most common in LatAm
	- They're developing presidential democracies
	- Weak institutionalised party systems
#### Social movement
- "Social movements are usually described as informal networks... characterized by a continuous engagement of individuals and political groups that have a clear adversary and seek to promote collective action in the pursuit of a common objective"
- Whereas social movements normally develop a frame for specific groups, e.g. women, immigrants, the unemployed, populism talks about "the people" as one homogenous group
	- \[though it can be exclusionary in terms of who it says is part of this people]
- But major political corruption scandals etc lead to a large enough group of aggrieved individuals that a populist social movement can emerge
- Tea Party as an example
#### Political parties
- They perform at least three important roles
	- "aggregate the interests of different sectors of society"
	- "elaborate policy programs... to the voting public"
	- "invest time and resources to train personnel"
- An ideological tension between populism and parties
	- \[didn't read/think about carefully]
- Most European countries have at least one populist party
	- Some of them are just pseudo-parties centred around a leader
	- But others like National Front (FN), Austrian Freedom Party, PiS have built up internal structures and so on
- FN has a youth wing, international branches, sets up trade unions, etc
	- But Marine le Pen still has a huge amount of individual power
#### Dynamic model
- Often what happens in Europe is a charismatic leader takes over an established, non-populist party and transforms it
- Populist social movements rarely last long, because they lack a national leader or organisation
- If a populist social movement gets a leader who then builds a political party, the movement often loses momentum
	- \[why??]
## Socio-cultural approach
- High vs low
	- the rich are not necessarily high; the poor are not necessarily low
	- (e.g. Bush was lower than Gore even though the former wealthier)
	 ![[Pasted image 20240304132951.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240304133118.png]]

- Populists are able to tell things as they are, say the uncomfortable truths that the politically correct elites refuse to, etc
- The low is warmer more relatable, more immediate / close to the people
- Argues that the left-right axis is less unidimensional that then high-low one
	- left-right competition is over values and also material concerns; somewhat decoupled from each other with postmaterialism etc; growth of the left-liberals and the working class authoritarians
![[Pasted image 20240304133522.png]]
- An interesting spatial thing about a "wheel of axes of political polarisation"
![[Pasted image 20240304133842.png]]
- Ordinality of populist-ness i.e. more/less populist

## Political-strategic approach
- “Populism is best defined as a political strategy through which a personalistic leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unmediated, uninstitutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers”
## Questions
- Why is class struggle/false consciousness in Communism "antithetical" to populism? Likewise, why is Fascism's focus on the state and race non-populist?
- Did UKIP really advocate for (or more importantly, did its supporters support) neoliberal free trade & unilaterally cutting tariffs, etc? Closing borders doesn't sound very neoliberal to me...
- Why exactly can the Tea Party be described as a populist social movement, but other movements are not populist?
