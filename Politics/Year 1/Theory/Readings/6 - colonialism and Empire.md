## Mills: The Racial Contract
### intro / overview
- it doesn't make much sense to me for Mills to argue that the _ultimate_ reason for European success was colonialism (which is at least what he implies, deliberately I think)
	- because there was nothing fundamental stopping African and Asian states colonising European ones, if they were technologically advanced enough (and morally unscrupulous, I guess.)
- he makes a historical claim about the Racial Contract, but - from chapter 1 at least - there doesn't seem to be much discussion of normative things
	- i.e., is it _necessarily_ the case that a social contract cannot be racial in nature?
	- if Rousseau and Locke had not been racists, then couldn't the social contract that was agreed upon been inclusionary?
	- can't we author one now?
- yes, there are systematic ("structural", if you prefer) racial inequalities
	- \[the one that sticks in my head from elsewhere is that the average Black household wealth is 1/10th that of average White household, I think]
	- is that all he is saying? it seems quite an unradical work, today at least
### details
> On the local level of spatialization, norming then manifests itself in the presumption that certain spaces (e.g., those of the inner city) are intrinsically doomed to welfare dependency, high street crime, underclass status, because of the characteristics of its inhabitants, so that the larger economic system has no role in creating these problems


> The reality is that one can pretend the body does not matter only because a particular body (the white male body) is being presupposed as the somatic norm. In a political dialogue be- tween the owners of such bodies, the details of their flesh do not matter since they are judged to be equally rational, equally capable of perceiving natural law or their own self-interest. But as feminist theorists have pointed out, the body is only irrelevant when it’s the (white) male body.
- yes, this is a reasonable point, have reflected on it before
	- perhaps I am White, according to the standards of the contract, which is why my body does not matter?
- nonwhite people are sub-persons
> For the Racial Contract, correspondingly, a basic inequality is asserted in the capacity of different human groups to know the world and to detect natural law. Subpersons are deemed cognitively inferior, lacking in the essential rational- ity that would make them fully human.
> 
> In the early (theological) versions of the Racial Contract, this difference was spelled out in terms of heathen unwillingness to recognize God’s word... In later, secular versions, it is a raced incapacity for rationality, abstract thought, cultural development, civilization in general In philosophy one could trace this common thread through Locke’s speculations on the incapacities of primitive minds, David Hume’s denial that any other race but whites had created worthwhile civilizations \[...]

- the state as enforcing the racial contract:
> we need another alternative, another way of theorizing about and critiquing the state: the racial, or white supremacist, state, whose function inter alia is to safeguard the polity as a white or white-dominated polity, enforcing the terms of the Racial Contract by the appropriate means and, when necessary, facilitating its rewriting from one form to another... the state established by the Racial Contract is by definition not neutral, since its purpose is to bring about conformity to the terms of the Racial Contract among the subperson population, which will obviously have no reason to accept these terms voluntarily, since the contract is an exploitation contract.
- police brutality, and in the past crushing of slave revolts etc, are all part of enforcing this
	- "The death penalty is differentially applied to nonwhites both in the scope of crimes covered... and in its actual carrying out"
- lynchings, etc
- ideological enforcement, making nonwhites consent to the contract
	- e.g. cultivating a sense of inferiority (this feels in the Marxist tradition about false consciousness?)
### Naturalized merits
- yes, this is the objection I had:
> modern contractarianism has long since given up real-world explanatory pretensions, being hypothetical, subjunctive exercises in ideal theory. So the fact that actual societies were not based on these norms, even if true, and unfortunate, is simply irrelevant. These are just two different kinds of projects.
- I think basically his response is that < in order for an ideal theory to make good recommednations about the direction in which we should take society, it needs to have good contact with empirical facts about present society, and these raceless theories are not >
> the absence from most white moral/political philosophy of discussions of race and white supremacy would lead one to think that race and racism have been marginal to the history of the West... there is the impression that the modern European nation-states were not centrally affected by their imperial history and that societies such as the United States were founded on noble moral principles meant to include everyone, but unfortunately, there were some deviations
- goes on about how the racial contract respects the reality of the world, etc etc
- but I think even if you accept that systematic racism has been the rule (not the exception), you could say that contractarian ideal accounts are perfectly useful models of where we want to end up??

> Whiteness is not really a color at all, but a set of power relations
