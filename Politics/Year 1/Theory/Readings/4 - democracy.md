- deliberative democracy on Wikipedia:
> Deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting.
## Inclusion and Democracy
https://academic.oup.com/book/3941
- with an unclear argument, says that democracy is primarily valuable for instrumental reasons
	- preventing rulers from abusing power
	- everyone is able to influence policy
	- best means of promoting justice
- will criticise aggregative democracy
	- "a reinforcing circle between social and economic inequality and political inequality that enables the powerful to use formally democratic processes to perpetuate injustice or preserve privilege"
	- deliberative democracy is a way to break the circle
### Two models of democracy
- less about institutional arrangements, more about the process by which decisions are made
#### Aggregative
- Presents criticisms of it:
- We take people's preferences as they are, with no regard to how they're arrived at
	> some preferences may be motivated by self‐interest, others by altruistic care for others, and still others by a sense of fair play... There are no criteria for distinguishing the quality of preferences by either content, origin, or motive
- I'm not that bothered by this, though we should perhaps give more weight to wise people's preferences if they're likely to lead to better fulfilment of the populus's long-term/considered preferences

- there is no "public" that gets together specially to make decisions, people just submit their private preferences

- "it carries a thin and individualistic form of rationality... the aggregate outcome has no necessary rationality and itself has not been arrived at by a process of reasoning... preference orderings when aggregated may yield a different ordering than those the individuals hold singly"
	- OK? but it's arrived at by a mechanism to aggregate preferences
	- Is the last sentence gesturing at impossibility theorem results or something?

- doesn't let people appeal to objective morality to defend the legitimacy of policy
	- "On this subjectivist interpretation, if people use moral language, they are simply conveying a particular kind of preference or interest which is no more rational or objective than any other."

- "there is no reason why those who do not share those preferences ought to abide by the results. They may simply feel that they have no choice but to submit, given that they are in the minority"
	- wait this is just an obvious contraction - she's just said that their being in the minority is the reason for them to abide by the results...

#### Deliberative
- We might instead "associate democracy with open discussion and the exchange of views leading to agreed‐upon policies"
	- "participants aim to persuade one another of the rightness of their positions"
- But I don't really understand how this is massively different from aggregative democracy
	- we still try and persuade people, about what are the effective means of realising their preferences (valence-based competition), and also what the ends ought to be
	- and then people vote, based on that
- \[gave up]

### Limitations of some deliberative models
> This view sees the only alternatives as either a process of aggregation of preferences in which each interest competes with the others to get the most for themselves, without concern for others, or a public‐spirited dialogue which puts aside private interests and affiliation.47 In Chapter 3 I argue that this is a false dichotomy.

## The Right to a Competent Electorate
- "Restricted suffrage of might be unjust, but less unjust than unconditional universal suffrage."
- having a vote gives you power over other people; you should be competent to be allowed to exercise power
- people can be ignorant, irrational, or morally unreasonable
	- their aggregated decisions lack legitimacy, like those from such a jury
- "We cannot deprive anyone of liberty, property or life be cause of an incompetent decision merely because other juries are competent."
	- and similarly not because a given jury was competent in other cases, though not in this one case
- government decisions are momentous
	- "Citizens and others within the government’s domain are forced to comply, even if they have excellent grounds for non-compliance, and even if they know that the decisions were made incompetently."
### Against restricted suffrage
> Estlund concludes that we cannot justify democracy by invoking the notion of fairness. The goal of keeping pro cedures fair does not uniquely select democracy in preference to other alternative decision-making methods \[coin flips, lotteries]
- Three conditions for an epistocracy (Estlund)
1. The truth tenet: there are correct answers to (at least some) political questions 
2. The knowledge tenet: some citizens know more of these truths than others 
3. The authority tenet: when some citizens have greater knowledge, this justifies granting them political authority over those with lesser knowledge.
- Estlund rejects authority tenet \[I don't, at least not instinctively]
	- Expert/boss fallacy
- Presents a different version of (3):
	- The anti-authority tenet: when some citizens are morally unreasonable, ignorant or incompetent about politics, this justifies not granting them political authority over others.
> Epistocrats need not argue that experts should be bosses: they need argue only that those with little expertise should not be bosses.
- "qualified acceptability requirement" for bases of distributing political power
	- What does it mean to be acceptable to all "qualified" points of view?
	- For example with voter exams, people might reasonably disagree about where to draw the line of pass vs fail
- Demographic objection
	- Maybe the people who pass the bar are all of the same gender / race etc. And this leads to hidden biases / prejudices and so worse outcomes
### The lesser evil
- Voting age requirements don't meet qualified acceptability either
	- And they could fall subject to demographic objection too
> suppose we require that citizens must have medical degrees in order to be surgeons; but members of certain historically oppressed groups, thanks to their disadvan taged upbringing, fail to be in a position to attend medical school. If so, this would not make the law requiring a medical degree unjust
- Some complicated theoritcal point about a qualified person demanding that decisions pass the competence pricniple
### In practice
- \[Rhode Island is a "corrupt state"??]
- various obvious bits and bobs
- Mentions Burke and conservatism for some reason; not changing things too much; but experiments can be fine
### Conclusion
> democracy violates the competence principle, whereas epistocracy violates the qualified acceptability requirement
- So they're both unjust, but epistocracy is less unjust, because having voting age laws is less unjust than incompetent juries.
## Democracy, Political Equality, and Majority Rule
### Abstract / summary / intro
> no general argument for democracy, whether based on its intrinsic fairness, conduciveness to better decisions, or valuable by-products, necessarily implies majority rule

- I like this article!
	- But the point about lotteries seems pretty obvious to me
		- Perhaps because I've read about the "proportional chances" voting from Moral Parliaments paper
	- Also, if you hold that democracy doesn't need to have equal weight, but not too dissimilar weight, then you need to either accept that it has fuzzy boundaries (with oligarchy) \[I support this], or have a silly discontinuous switch
> Since the procedure appears rigged against them from the start, it seems more like someone proposing that they agree to toss a biased coin to settle their disagreement.
- But consider, e.g., Rawls and the Original Position. Even if *a priori* the system is not rigged, it might still, when actualised, condemn some to be in a permanent minority. This doesn't disqualify it from being a just system.

- A lottery over outcomes might be fair, but not democratic, since it's not responsive to citizens' preferences
- Majority rule might be democratic but not fair, when there's a permanent minority \[hmm]
- So a lottery over who gets to be a dictator (which is effectively what this is) may sometimes be best

- This is an interesting point I guess
> if we assume that there may be a wise minority in society, on at least some issues, then allowing them to get their way and be proved right means that in future more people may defer to their judgment, making it more likely that future decisions will be right

- I am not convinced by this really
> politics often involves making decisions between two alternatives neither of which is objectively worse
- It's totally fair to say that we may not know which alternative is better. But the decisions being made in politics are sufficiently complicated that I really doubt that there actually are multiple options which are Pareto-efficient (and definitely not aggregatively maximising)

### Arguments for majority rule
Perversity of minority rule
- Yeah this is a non-argument if you think about expectations of probabilities
Maximization of self-determination
- Interesting, I don't care too much about self-determination
- But a reasonable point that lotteries may lead to less of it, though more fairly / evenly distributed
Respect 
- I don't really think the argument here is about respect, but anyway
- Makes the point that under a lottery, it is always rational for the majority group to try and seek more support from their opponents, which is good
Condorcet’s jury theorem
- This is my main objection. Relatedly, I think there's also a lot higher variance in outcomes when you do a lottery compared with majority? (Or something like this. I'm thinking about how the sample mean is a more efficient estimator that taking the value of one X_i)
- Counterargument 1: perhaps the conditions aren't met in democracies (yeah sure, rational irrationality leading to systematic biases, etc)
- Counterargument 2: there might be indeterminacy about the right answer \[this is a bad argument]
May’s theorem
- Some formal social choice theory stuff about majority rule being the only decision system to meet certain desiderata
- But lotteries meet this in a slightly weakened and still intuitive way, just they're not deterministic
- \[this argument is more about majority rule over other deterministic systems imo]
Compromise
- As an application of Downs and the median voter theorem, majority rule favours "middle ground" solutions
	- But again this requires certain conditions to be met
- Ex ante, people may prefer to have proportional chances (i.e. a lottery)
	- This could be an argument in favour of majority rule too!! See point about about original position. Though of course maybe in the original position we'd choose a lottery system.
### Objections to lottery rule
- If you have cross-cutting cleavages and majorities form differently on different issues, then maybe no need to use lotteries
	- Going with majority rule would lead to greater aggregate happiness
		- \[formally, is this true?]
- Extreme minorities might win sometimes
	- Yeah, this is part and parcel of democracy... If you think you can determine which minorities are sensible and which aren't, then why bother with popular rule?
		- "The reason the KKK’s policies should not be enacted, however, is because they are unjust, not because they are a minority—we would not want them enacted even if the KKK won a majority"
	- There is a valid point about asymmetries and diminishing utility or something, though. If the KKK happens to win, the bad from that is really huge. Whereas the second-best option is probably not a load worse than the best.
	- You can protect rights with a judiciary and so on, just like how in majority systems you do the same. 
	- You can put a minimum threshold before being counted, like how there's a floor to get seats in the legislature in countries with PR voting
	- Maybe people will cast fewer protest votes for extreme parties if the more moderate minority parties had a chance of success, by switching to a lottery system
		- Have some faith in the people; personal responsibility among voters
	- "Perhaps the fact that anyone could lose will encourage all to think more seriously about the position of losers."
- Unequal outcomes
	- This is just an objection for people who don't like the idea of expectations, I think
	- Someone might argue we should do deterministic proportional turn-taking about who gets to dictate the decision, rather than have it be chance-based. But this is silly and obviously not practical
- Reduces deliberation
	- "Since even the most hardened deliberative democrat usually recognizes the practical impossibility of reaching complete consensus through deliberation"
		- This captures why I'm confused about what deliberative democracy actually wants.
	- But in fact, incentives are better lined up - people on the majority side really do care about persuading more over, even once they've got a majority. So there's likely to be more negotiation etc
	- A weak argument that gets easily rebutted about how maybe if people start out opposing something 30/70 and then switch over to favouring it 60/40, it seems like that proposition has "won the argument" and so it ought to pass
		- But there may just be a conflict of interests between the groups, rather than about facts. So it's perfectly reasonable to still do a lottery
- Inconsistency
	- This is a practical objection and quite a fair one actually. If you voted on issues at a very granular level, then the randomness might mean that e.g. the decision is made to raise VAT on flapjacks and cut VAT on brownies, or whatever
		- If views on the topics were highly correlated, then there wouldn't be a huge amount of inconsistency, but still more than if you just used majority rule
		- One solution is just to package up policies to be voted on at a higher level? Though this then does mean there's less flexibility and detail, e.g. about "what should the exact level of military spending be?"
	- Majority rule doesn't necessarily yield consistency though
		- You could have separate majorities form on a triad of issues which cannot all be achieved at once
		- Also when we have "cyclical majorities" i.e. Tory then Labour rule alternating
	> Before lottery voting could be implemented, much more thought would need to be given to agenda-setting mechanisms. We may, for example, need ways to stop defeated groups bringing the same policy immediately back to the table, hoping to get lucky next time.

### Conclusion
> The choice of the appropriate decision-making rule seems to depend upon the context and what is to be decided... \[lotteries] may be preferable in certain circumstances, for example, where it gives a permanent minority hope of having their preferences satisfied sometimes

> more care needs to be taken to justify majority rule in particular, rather than only the more general principles of democracy or political equality.
