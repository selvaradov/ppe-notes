·       What is liberty, how does Mill construe it

·       Various bits in the intro

o   P68 on harm principle

o   P63 includes protection against social coercion as well as physical

o   P60 the classical idea of liberty as just protecting people from its government; Mill goes beyond that as people **are** the government

o   P71 three liberties: free expression & belief, free tastes & pursuits, free association

·       P79 we need free speech because otherwise we don’t give our opinions the opportunity to be contradicted. And so then it’s not valid to assume they’re correct and act on them more generally.

§  Mill accepts that “on every matter not self-evident there are ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it for one who is capable”. So this can be the basis for a thought experiment/argument that maybe we let bad ideas spread that have bad consequences since some people aren’t able to have “clearer perception and livelier impression of the truth induced by its collision with error” (p 76)

o   P87 on Marcus Aurelius and how you must think you’re a better man than him if you’re going to go aoround banning stuff

·       Three reasons for free speech (well, he calls it four, summary on pg 115-6)

o   The banned speech might be true

o   It might be false, but the received wisdom has to be challenged to remain a living truth

o   The banned speech might contain kernels of truth

·       P111 “only through diversity of opinion is there … a chance of fair play to all sides fo the truth”

o   114 also lots of plurality as a means to an end

o   P115 makes empirical claims about how hearing both sides of the truth is good

·       P120 more evidence that liberty is instrumental about it being “useful” to have experiments

o   And also presents it as ingredient of human happiness, not its own good

·       P125, more points on instrumentality

·       P127 claim that individuality makes people more valuable to each other. Bottom of 128 also

·       P133 I know my utility function the best

·       P136 liberty as the only source of improvement/progress

·       But on the other hand, liberty as categorically good etc:

o   P142-3 don’t interfere with others’ lives

o   151 also

o   P173 – not allowed to give up your freedom

o   “It is possible that he might be guided in some good path […] But what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it.”

·       Parts which can go either way

o   P149 when talking about punishing sb not for being drunk, but for the direct effects of their drunkenness (if those exist)

·       P168 crimes against decency – well that contradicts free speech section (religious tolerance etc)

·       P179 bits on the expediency of laws (about you have to have money to support a family before getting married)

·       P185 “no absolute rule”
