## JustifyingÂ Lockdown
Three arguments about government restricting liberties:
### Paternalism
- it's better for each person to be in lockdown
- and so the govt can interfere in their best interest
### Altruism
- we have goodwill for others
	- \[it makes no sense at all how you turn this into an argument for govt coercion to be altruistic tho, if ppl are sufficiently other-regarding then they'll stay home from their own choice...]
### Preventing Excessive Harm
- more like harm principle, there are limits to the harm we may impose on others
- goes on some silly tangents through causality & moral responsibility, also on expectation vs actual harm
## Recreational drugs and paternalism
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00172032
### I (intro)
- against criminal laws against the use of recreational drugs (CLAURD)
	- and in particular, defends the rights of drug users, as opposed to making a different civil liberties argument
### II (summary)
- will distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable paternalism (assuming some is acceptable)
- won't focus on whether there are harms to others from drug use (and so a non-paternalistic reason to criminalise)
- points out paternalistic arguments are different to legal moralism (the view that if something is immoral, that is sufficient reason to ban it)
- maybe some of the reason that drugs are so harmful is their illegality
	- i.e. people fail to seek treatment, they're very expensive, etc etc
	- \[fine, though this is empirical and I doubt he will marshal strong evidence on it]
- will talk about how you can distinguish between permissible and impermissible drugs
	- "What properties must a drug possess so that sound paternalistic principles justify its prohibition? What properties must a drug possess so that there could be no reasonable basis for criminalizing or even discouraging its use?"
- Feinberg and the "garrison threshold", seems to be basically the idea that certain actions may be purely self-regarding when done only by a small number of people, but then cause harm to society when done on a large scale
	- hmm, maybe interesting? from a kind of decision theory point of view also
### III (defences of CLAURD)
- consequentialist and deontological pro-choice arguments
	- Mill is former, Feinberg latter
	- but he will focus on deontological because the consequentialist ones are too tricky and can't be solved from armchairs \[ARGHGHGHGHGHH]
- problems for consequentialists who favour CLAURD
	- people derive pleasure from drugs, so why ban them?
		> First, it might be contended that consumers do not really want, enjoy, or derive satisfaction from recreational drug use.
	
	- but as he points out, this is a bit of a bait-and-switch
	> sleight-of-hand that results from positing an alleged "rational will", and then supposing that a person's "true wants" can be identified apart from his expressed desires

- (of course, you could hold that people are not very rational at all, and get stuck in local minima. I think this probably is the harm of drug-taking. Also, people aren't helping society progress if they're just on drugs the whole time, and they have a consequentialist moral obligation to e.g. donate money, develop new science, etc etc)
- \[is it really true that "The model of the drug user who would like to quit but cannot overcome his addiction applies only to a small percentage of individuals."]
- He also says a utilitarian could "contend that the pleasure derived from drug use, although genuine, is pathological", like the pleasure a rapist derives
	- I don't think this is a legitimate move
- what on earth does this mean? 
> it is preferable (as most philosophers have realized) to reject theories that approach these sorts of issues by balancing aggregate utility against disutlity.

- Feinberg talks about autonomy, including right to choose what you put into your body
	- maybe a CLAURD defender can say that putting drugs into your body is an unimportant thing so doesn't matter if the law bans it
		- but, as he points out, seems peculiar that autonomy doesn't include deciding for yourself what is and isn't important...
	- or maybe above some level of harm the state can be paternalistic
		- the "Analysis" article talks about how this doesn't really work. 
		- apparently "many philosophers hold that the autonomy principle protects the decision to commit suicide", which he then says must involve much more harm than drug taking
	- From Feinburg (this is utterly insane to me). He thinks only soft paternalism is OK, i.e. the only self-regarding conduct the state can stop is when it's harmful and non-voluntary
> a person's right of self-determination, being sovereign, takes precedence even over his own good
### IV (Mr Roe and Dr Doe)
- starts with three Feinberg examples of when drug use can be intervened with or not
- the thing Faye was talking about wrt whether individual level is different to government level:
> A defense of paternalism in inter-personal relationships may not lead to a defense of paternalistic legislation.
- Husak thinks that people are generally rational, take drugs for enjoyment, realise that there's a risk of harm
- and anyway, under a deontological framework we should be much less willing to "allow the good of some to be enhanced by sacrificing the moral autonomy of others"
	- i.e. banning drugs because "some individuals, perhaps even a majority, will use a drug nonvoluntarily"
	- though I'm not super convinced here; for the nonvoluntary drug users surely it's autonomy-*enhancing* for there to be a ban. But because it's deontology you're not allowed to break any rules (autonomy) even if doing so is a way to fix some that are being broken (the nonvoluntary users). I don't like this way of thinking
### V (addiction)
- maybe if somebody gets addicted, it's then non-voluntary, so soft paternalism would license banning use
- three types of addiction
	- tolerance, i.e. they need more of the drug to get same hit
	- psychological centrality of the drug compared to other things
	- physical dependence, withdrawal symptoms
	- \[2 and 3 seem similar? In that you have psychological pain / unhappiness from withdrawing as opposed to physical (tho it is all physical selon moi)]
- He says 1 and 2 aren't evidence for it being non-voluntary
	- "the fact that greater dosages of a substance are required to attain the same effect cannot render use of that substance less than fully voluntary"
		- on its own, sure, but when coupled with psychological centrality I think it sort of is?
	- we don't intervene paternalistically with people who have wealth / sex / operas as psychologically central to their lives
- anyway, addiction isn't a good reason to support CLAURD as it stands since caffeine is addictive and LSD is not
	-  yeah, true, I do fundamentally agree that current drug laws seem dumb and arbitrary. Though probably I wouldn't support legalising everything. I think the world is better with nobody smoking, for example.
- talks about how judicial systems haven't allowed nonvoluntariness to be a defence against drug use
	- (cf Hi Phi episode on free will. I think this is more about CJ system being unfair & prejudiced against drug users though. I guess paternalistic me would say that)
	- still, this is a good way of showing some inconsistency in addiction being an argument in support of CLAURD
- aha Feinberg does have the courage RE freedom to give up freedom that Mill lacked
> Feinberg, to his credit, remains consistent here. The fact that a decision to become a slave is permanent and irrevocable is not a sufficient reason to label it as nonvoluntary or to prohibit it.
- similarly, the fact that a drug is addictive is not sufficient for it to be certainly nonvoluntary
- also, the drug case is much weaker than the slave case for four reasons, Husak says:
	- you don't get addicted to drugs rightaway after one use, whereas you're a slave and that's that
	- not all users of addictive drugs become addicts
	- addiction isn't always permanent
	- withdrawal is perhaps not as difficult as people think (idk, have no evidence on this myself)
### VI (personal integrity)
- John Kleinig and a defence of harder paternalism
	- basically, if we're doing things that go against our "permanent, stable, and central projects" then people intervening with those projects in mind are enhancing our integrity
	- and he says that because of our fallibilities, we might often "manifest \[such] a carelessness, unreflectiveness, short-sightedness..."
- Husak: "Interference in such cases does not substitute another's preferences for those of the agent, but actually helps the agent to pursue his own goals."
	- i.e. a selective intention multiplier
- but this is tricky to use to defend CLAURD
	- do drugs interfere with people's projects? to an extent more than other things?
	- and makes the same point above about a deontological framework - you can't trade off some people's rights for the good of others
