## Autonomy and Hate Speech
https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199548781.003.0009
- From the abstract
> the chapter gives reasons to believe that the attempt to prohibit hate speech is more likely to exacerbate the risk of unacceptable outcomes than to generate the benign opposite
- So, in other words, it's going to argue that instrumentally we shouldn't ban hate speech, based on some empirical claims.
### Introduction
- Presents the naive argument for banning hate speech
> Whether or not the ban will be effective in even a few cases at preventing genocide or racial violence, the mere possibility that it will more than justifies the ban.
- He will go on to "defend a theory of why racist or hate speech should be protected" and also "describes the empirical evidence that would cause me to abandon the theory"
- Some stuff saying that US vs European legal differences aren't as big as made out to be
### Autonomy and legitimacy
- Argues that
	- (i) the legitimacy of the state depends on its respect for people’s equality and autonomy
	- (ii) the state only respects people’s autonomy if it allows people in their speech to express their own value
- Something about formal autonomy as opposed to substantive, and how it's "an on/off value"
	- I think this is sort of similar to negative vs positive liberty. 
> 	"Substantive autonomy involves a person’s actual capacity and opportunities to lead the best, most meaningful, self-directed life possible... by allocating resources to her or providing her information, for example"
- OK, and from this he argues that you can't ban hate speech, because the right to express it is formal autonomy, whereas wanting to not hear it is substantive
> Law’s purposeful restrictions on her racist or hate speech violate her formal autonomy, while her hate speech does not interfere with or contradict anyone else’s formal autonomy even if her speech does cause injuries that sometimes include undermining others’ substantive autonomy.
- "Pragmatic balancers"
	- Makes the point that maybe protecting hate speech might end up leading to better outcomes even for the people who have racist stuff said about them \[presumably the story about why this is true comes later]
- Other people might argue that free speech is only protected within the scope of democracy
	- So speech which advocates for non-democratic change, e.g. lawbreaking, violence, etc can be banned
	- Likewise, anti-democratic speech that says some participants in the democracy are not equal to others
	- \[hmmm.]
- then he says he doesn't like the democratic account for some reason or another \[this is so boringly written]
### Objections and reply
- Maybe people say that there's historical evidence hate speech went along with genocide etc. But that's difficult
> It would \[need to] show whether, even if causal in that historical context, it would be so under different historical conditions... The account would need to show, in addition, that _the specific hate speech_ that proposed legal regulations would effectively prevent was at least a contributing cause of virulent racist or genocidal practices
- Talks about five empirical premisses that need to be met to justify hate speech bans
	- Focusses on (iii) "legal prohibitions of hate speech would actually be an effective place to intervene in the causal chain" and (iv) "these legal bars on hate speech would not reduce the efficaciousness or likelihood of other... interventions that would be more effective in preventing virulent racist acts"
- on (iii), basically arguing that early on the hateful speech will be only borderline offensive and so go uncensored, whilst later on "enforcement will not occur, will be counter-productive in creating martyrs for a racist cause, or will focus on the wrong targets \[i.e. the very people being oppressed]"
- on (iv), makes a tenuous claim that -- in the tradition of Mill -- competition in the marketplace of ideas means that racist ideas will be driven out
	> the _pragmatic_ claim is that to allow people the option to express their dreadful views is less dangerous than to attempt to outlaw this expression
### Evils restrictions may cause
> also as an empirical matter, my suspicion is that prohibitions on hate speech will actually exacerbate problems, will increase the likelihood of horrendous results
1. Without free speech, the unhateful truth might become a sterile dogma (this is just the same point as above really)
	a. But people should still criticise the ideas they disagree with; "reject, not tolerate, evil counsels and evil endeavours"
> 	As an empirical hypothesis, I suggest that more active (and thus more effective) opposition to racist views is likely to come from social practices of not tolerating racist expression than from laws making it illegal
2. Banning racist speech makes it go underground so you don't know the extent of it (Mill says this too)
3. Banning speech makes racists feel like they're being oppressed and illegitimately denied their right to express opinions, so then they get more radicalised
4. We want people to *express* their offensive values politically, rather than physically, but banning speech shifts conflict back into "the plane of violence"
5. It's a waste of political energy / capital; we should instead improve socioeconomic conditions for the racists so they aren't marginalised and don't end up having those beliefs
	a. Talks about anti-pornography-censorship feminists as an example of a group which recognised this
	b. "this politics favours the superficial"
6. It's a slippery slope, and will end up being turned against minorities by majorities (Mill, again, says this)
	a. i.e., "to punish activists among oppressed groups for the criticism of dominant groups" 
	b. it's a slippery slope, and the extent of free speech restrictions will spread, primarily on heterodox outsiders -- the very people we ought to protect 
- Summarises at the end of the section
### Conclusion
- Gives an example about Rwanda prosecution of a journalist
> if cycles of oppression and societal violence are to be broken, a society desperately needs to create a culture of open expression where all views, especially the most extreme views, are openly expressed and debated
- Overall, doesn't think that hate speech restrictions will make genocides less likely
	1. They'll be ineffective
	2. They may contribute to the rise of racism
	3. Free speech protections are a way to prevent the rise of racism
- Accepts that "hate speech causes many real harms, many real injuries"
	- And says you could make the argument that these injuries are sufficient justification to prohibit it
	- But denies the conclusion (though doesn't really say why; just that he thinks that's a matter for another essay)
	- "though the arguments that racist speech causes real harms is surely right, that point is hardly unique to racist speech"
> Liberty is the choice if people are fundamentally good and worthy of respect—suppression is the choice if the opposite holds factually.
- according to him, "given that the answer is not writ in stone, that guess can be a self-fulfilling prophesy", i.e. we should choose liberty and thus cause people to be good. \[yay]
## Does Freedom of Speech Include Hate Speech?
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11158-011-9158-y.pdf?pdf=button
- From abstract
> I suggest that ‘hate speech’ is too broad a designation to be usefully analysed as a single category, since it includes many different kinds of speech acts, each of which involves very different kinds of free speech interests, and may cause very different kinds of harm
- distinguishes between four types, some are "uncovered", some "unprotected" but covered, some "protected"
- The conlusion:
> targeted vilification is uncovered speech, that diffuse vilification and organised political advocacy for exclusionary and eliminationist policies is unprotected speech, and that other assertions of fact and value, including so-called group libel, are protected speech.
### Introduction
- assumes that there is a Free Speech Principle
	- with a broad conception of speech as all forms of expression
	- "all acts which intend to communicate some message"
		- i.e. must have some propositional content?
	- something something about it going beyond simply negative liberty that Mill promotes
		- though Mill doesn't really promote negative liberty in general; his focus is on *basic* liberties, of which free speech is a specific one (e.g. SEP article).
		- "a more stringent standard of justification \[is required] for the restriction of speech than for other activities."
- Defines hate speech as "speech which attacks others on grounds of their race, nationality, religious identity, gender, sexual orientation or other group membership, where this group membership is a morally arbitrary distinguishing characteristic."
	- excludes pornography
- coverage vs protection
	- Some things aren't covered by FSP, e.g. "crimes like perjury, bribery, insider trading, solicitations to commit crimes"
	- There are other things which are covered, but are not protected, because of doing so is "clearly outweighed by other compelling interests". For example, defamation
		- It has to be harmful, though harmful is not sufficient, since some harmful speech *is* protected
		- there's something similar with "legal but harmful" content in the UK online safety bill, though not exactly this category
> speech does not become unprotected simply when ad hoc weighing of the benefits and harms reveals that regulation tends to produce greater benefit than harm—there must be a compelling interest or counter-value in favour of regulation which would survive a more stringent demand for justification than for uncovered speech or non-speech activities
- This seems to be to be an almost impossible test to perform
	- What on earth does it mean to say that the demand for justification is more stringent? You have to be super-duper confident that on balance it's better to ban? 
	- Because otherwise this just collapses into \<it needs to be better on balance to ban>, where the costs of banning are high since free speech is valuable
- Regulable vs should be regulated
	- where "regulable" means its regulation would be compatible with the FSP
	-  "It may be that regulable speech, for reasons independent of free speech concerns, should not be regulated."
		- i.e. speech which should be regulated is a subset of that which is regulable (because we're not allowed to violate the FSP? sure...)
		- gives the example that maybe prohibiting theoretically regulable speech would in fact be counterproductive, as discussed in the Baker
	- The article is focussed on regulable, i.e. the theoretical not empirical side
### Justifications for the Free Speech Principle
- Divides them up into consequentialist (instrumental) vs non-consequentialist (rights-based)
	- For the former, discusses (1) truth-tracking, (2) self-fulfilment and personal development
	- For the latter, (3) participation in democratic self-government, (4) autonomy
#### Truth
- gives a strong and weak version
	- strong: the notion that true ideas will drive out false ones
	- weak: authority isn't good at identifying true ideas so censorship doesn't work
- "the strength of the free speech values protected by this argument will simply be contingent on the value attached to truth... it is implausible to think that this value is absolute, or even that it has priority over other values and interests"
#### Development
- basically like autonomy
-  emphasises free speech as a way of promoting conditions in which people can grow intellectually sth sth
#### Self-government
- Because the people are sovereign, free speech is an important part of the deliberative process
	- if the government interferes with free speech, then the government is no longer a servant of the people, since it is choosing what they get to talk about
		- hmmm but citizens can choose a government that limits free speech right
		- \[no parliament can bind its successors sort of thing could get you out of this maybe]
- not super clear to me how this is a rights-based justification
- "this justification privileges political speech"
#### Autonomy
- Dworkin: government should show equal respect to all citizens; "equal respect implies a right to moral independence, and finally a right to freedom of speech"
	- distinguishes it from the development justification, but I think the difference is just means vs ends?
- talks about viewpoint neutrality
	- can't make regulations about speech in order to supress a message that you don't like
	- but if regulation about speech are neutral in justification, but not neutral in effect, i.e. "happens to disadvantage the ability of certain viewpoints to gain adherents... but does not aim at producing such a pattern of disadvantage" then that's fine
	- \[this is reminiscient of Mill on sin taxes]
- You can also talk about autonomy from the perspective of the audience
	- i.e. you shouldn't shield people from hearing things
	- "the audience has the right not to have possible mental inputs to its autonomous decision-making and deliberative processes restricted"
### Analysis by categories
#### Targeted vilification
> *Vilification* as a category of hate speech is speech whose dominant intention is to wound, insult or intimidate the audience, motivated by hostility towards or contempt for the audience’s racial or religious identity. *Targeted vilification* is vilificatory speech which is directed at a specific individual or small group of individuals.
- "the dominant *intention* is to wound and insult the hearer" (emphasis my own)
	- i.e. there is not "a real intention to communicate a particular evaluative opinion or political preference"
- Says this is uncovered by FSP, because "the aim is not to communicate an opinion or message with any cognitive content, but rather to induce certain psychological reactions in its targets"
	- seems similar to saying that it lacks propositional content
- claims that the individual making the comments can't have an actual interest in self-development from being allowed to say them
	- "it is implausible that someone’s self-fulfilment or personal development is served by her being able to emotively express her hostility and contempt for members of other racial or religious groups"
- But there's a problem here I think - as it notes, "often the emotive and cognitive elements of expression are inextricable"
	- Does this work as a response? "pounding one’s fists against the wall, or wearing eccentric clothes, might be forms of emotive self-expression... but they are clearly not covered by the FSP"
	- I guess maybe? but if I thought harder about it probably there's some way that hate speech is different
#### Diffuse vilification
- e.g. "proposed Nazi march through the Illinois village of Skokie, or the mock slave auction staged by white fraternity pledges in blackface at the University of Wisconsin."
- Again, talks about intentions
	- "the choice of outrageous symbolic behaviour is strong indication that political advocacy, or the communication of some evaluative opinion was not the main intention in these and similar cases"
- apparently because the audience is wider, there are some free speech interests (??)
	- why?? what makes it true that "a Nazi march is at some level political speech" but putting a noose on somebody's desk is not??
- but, these free speech interests are very weak compared to the interest in not being harmed of those who are vilified
	- I don't understand what's being got at here:
> 	Note that this is not an instance of ad hoc balancing: it is a claim that relative to the central concerns that motivate the FSP itself, the claims of speakers to speak are weak in these cases.
- Because the vilification is not specifically targeted, it is avoidable, though not costlessly so
- This stuff about neutrality isn't very convincing
	- e.g. maybe I want to curb the harm inflicted by people being gay so I regulate that...
	- here the harm he's talking about is people being insulted or intimidated, but what's to say I can't be insulted or intimidated by homosexuality? Maybe you object that's absurd and silly, but you don't have access to my mental states.
> A law which regulates racist diffuse vilification because of the harms it produces would retain justificatory neutrality, since the law is not animated by moral repugnance for racist opinions but rather by a concern to curb the harm inflicted by such speech

#### Exclusion/elimination
> Exclusionary policies are those under which certain identifiable racial or religious groups are excluded from full and equal citizenship by being stripped of their civil and political rights, or otherwise being made to suffer systematic state-sanctioned discrimination. Eliminationist policies aim at removing certain racial or religious groups from the population through forced repatriation or violent ethnic cleansing.
- he thinks the FSP "discount\[s] the possibility that claims which support the violation of foundational principles of liberal justice are true"
	- huh???? this is absurd!! 
- I'm sorry, but if you don't think that majorities should be trusted -- which is a totally fine position to hold -- then don't couch this in "protecting democracy". 
	- like how Mill thinks we shouldn't let people give up their freedom, since he knows that is super valuable and so obviously they're wrong if they want to
	- \[oh, he draws this sort of analogy himself and claims it is to the benefit of his case...]
> Political advocacy and organisation in favour of exclusionary and eliminationist policies create the danger that an electoral majority might choose an anti-democratic government; we might say that this is a classic ‘paradox of democracy’.

> when faced with a choice between respecting the outcomes of democratic procedures, and the non violation of clear and foundational democratic values, it is reasonable to give priority to values over procedures
- So, he says that the autonomy justification is a good reason to think twice about banning free speech
	- in particular, for audience autonomy
- But that the objection only has force if we believe that the audience will in fact reject the claims made in the hateful speech
	- I don't get this. If the audience doesn't reject the claims, then maybe the claims are true. It seems utterly nonsensical to suppose that we know that some claims are false,  convincing to the majority, and therefore ought to be banned.
	- He allows himself to presuppose that it would be a "moral catastrophe" if exclusionary or eliminationist views take hold
	- makes some other argument too, that an agent might decide to limit their range of idea inputs so as to also limit the inputs of other people, but I don't follow
- wrt autonomy of the speakers, accepts that it does infringe on their autonomy, but that this isn't unjust because it's to protect another basic liberty
	- quotes Rawls: "in practice that a basic liberty can be limited or denied solely for the sake of one or more other basic liberties, \[but never] for reasons of public good" \[well to me this seems silly]
- note that in the conclusion to the section he doesn't actually commit to saying that this sort of speech *should be regulated*, just that it is *regulable*
	- which is rather timid
	- "It may be the case that no government can reliably be given the authority to make this difficult judgment without opening the way for abuse. Even if that is the case, however, my position here is, in my view, not affected"
#### Facts and values
- specifically, "assertions of fact and evaluative opinions"
- these are protected, because you can challenge them with 'more speech' (I really don't buy this)
> denigratory speech associating a particular racial or religious group with criminality or disease can be countered by arguments and assertions to the contrary, in a way that was not possible for mere vilification
- says group libel, i.e. false negative assertions about a group, shouldn't be banned
	- because it "cannot be easily classified as ‘true’ or ‘false’"
	- \[but other forms of speech you don't like can?]
## No Platforming
https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8e2408bf-c5e3-40b6-bac2-7358e9e98cba/files/rjm214q11n

- Says that liberals should sometimes accept no platforming in an academic institution
- Abstract
> No platforming should therefore be acceptable to liberals, in principle, in cases where it is used to support a university culture that maintains rigorous disciplinary standards, by denying attention and credibility to speakers who fall short of those standards.
- They "distinguish principles of academic freedom, which answer to the epistemic and intellectual aims of the university, from the wider free speech principles that govern the liberal public square"
### No Platforming: Then and Now
- a potted history of the phenomenon, starting in '70s
	- disinvitation as a different tactic to no platforming but similar in the relevant senses
> some practitioners of no platforming expressly reject liberal ideals. It is a familiar leftist critique, after all, that liberalism colludes in oppression: in its focus on individual negative liberty, its insistence on a distinction between the public and private realms, and its idealization of the public square as a place of reasoned deliberation.
- Aha, finally someone sensible-sounding
> Herbert Marcuse’s warning that—in the non-ideal conditions of actual political contestation—an ethos of “indiscriminate tolerance” won’t result in the triumph of truth, as Millian liberals hope, but instead, the triumph of views favored by the powerful.
- But they want a liberal defence of no platforming, using the fact that "the academy is not the public square, and is in fact by its very nature an institution in which content-based speech discrimination is the norm"
	- if you have a narrow view of the public square, then surely there are loads of places where free speech doesn't get protected. or is the academy super-special?
### Invoking the Harm Principle
- talks about a Germaine Greer anti-trans lecture getting no platformed
	- everyone there agreed that there's an assumed protection of free speech, except where outweighed by harms
	- the disagreement, they argue, was over whether Greer's lecture would have caused harm (to trans women, by provoking violence)
- Yes, this is a correct criticism of Mill
> This neat distinction between mere speech and dangerous verbal conduct starts to look tenuous on inspection, though.
- I don't agree with this, though. Why "kinds" of harms, and not "degree" of harm?
> If any sphere of expressive liberty is to be preserved, then, we will have to insist that only certain kinds of harms suffice to justify the regulation of speech, and we will have to specify which ones.
- They raise some perfectly sensible and obvious objections to Harm Principle and its muddiness
> Is merely feeling intimidated or discriminated against sufficient? If so, is it sufficient in every case, or only when the feeling is reasonable given what the speaker has said?
> Does the harmful influence have to be foreseeable, or intended, or neither? And if neither, is the speaker responsible for harmful outcomes that result from implausible interpretations of her expressed views?... Why couldn’t economists who denounce progressive welfare programs also be assigned blame (and no platformed) over the deprivations suffered by the poor due to the regressive welfare reforms they promote?
- Their reason for raising these is illustrating that these are not settled questions
	- (I think what they're trying to say is: if you want to justify no platforming, we've got an argument that will persuade people better than these ones can!)
	- indeed: "defenders of no platforming would do better to reason and argue not in terms of the norms of free speech, but the—importantly distinct— norms of academic freedom"
- \[lots of citations in all the sources of Schauer 1993]
### Distinguishing Academic Freedom from Free Speech
- They talk about how it's legitimate for there to be gate-keeping of speech in academic community, in order to help with the "realization of the epistemic aims of teaching and research"
	- Specifically, excluding non-experts; cranks; shills
- But I think there is a difference between something happening *on campus* and *in the academy*
	- ah - "some of the speaking engagements that no platformers target—like commencement addresses, or talks at student societies—are not immediately linked to teaching and research activities"
	- the defence is that they're still "part of the cultural and institutional backdrop". I guess true, but meh
- Reiterate how the goal of university is dissemination of expert knowledge, etc
	- They're important for democratic self-government because "everyone should have access to the knowledge and information necessary for well-informed judgments about how we ought to be governed"
	- so we need academic freedom i.e. independence from undue influence of politicians etc, but not a free-for-all
- This is all well and good, but I want to pre-register my scepticism that, for example, disinviting *academics* who have already got through the gatekeeping system (but now express unpopular views) can be justified in this manner
### Easier Cases and Harder Cases
- Holocaust denier and oil company climate denier can both be no-platformed
	- "make a joke of the intellectual standards to which teaching and research in these disciplines aspire"
	- and because having them speak would damage the institutional culture, there is a positive case to no-platform them
- On the other hand, no-platforming the scholarly anti-welfare economist would be wrong
	- yes, OK
- They say the nature of how students protest is important, and in particular whether "respect is paid to disciplinary expertise"
	- \[this doesn't seem to me to be a very insightful or original article.]
- Greer is a harder case, because "the governing disciplinary standards in this arena remain deeply contested"
	- i.e. there are some academics who think whether trans women are women is an important open question, and others who say it is not even a valid line of inquiry. 
	- \[my inclination would be that given the disciplinary standards are up for debate,  both lectures about those disciplinary standards (on a meta level), and lectures on the topics governed by those disciplinary standards, should both be protected within academic freedom]
- different fields have different views on what questions are and aren't up for debate
> In some disciplines these questions \[like the moral permissibility of abortion, infanticide, and eugenics, gender and racial equality, the labor theory of value, whether inductive inference is justified] are seen as legitimate objects of inquiry. In others they are seen as settled, sometimes axiomatically.
- this seems fine to me, in the sense that some questions are just not relevant to a field? 
	- Although perhaps people in the field where they think that abortion is definitely permissible ought to be shaken about from time to time by Marquis suggesting it isn't, etc
	- we don't want the axioms to become Mill's rigid dogma!
- Some introspection about philosophy as a field where lots of questions remain up for debate, when those same questions in other fields may be settled
- They say that
> our argument presupposes that normative moral and political claims—e.g. about the permissibility of homosexuality, or slavery, or the rights of trans people — can be the proper objects of disciplinary expertise
- but I don't quite see why
	- I think the idea is that we might no-platform speakers on the basis of their normative moral and political claims in the academy, and that is OK because the academic gatekeepers - those with "disciplinary expertise" - know more about them?
- also unclear what the point being made about academics abusing their position of expertise is
> claims to non-moral forms of disciplinary expertise \[can also be abused], as when biological research is used to defend claims about racial superiority
- then they make an extended point about how no-platforming can be seen as similar to peer review, etc, as a way of an academic discipline self-regulating
	- and although no-platforming is often done by students, they have some degree of disciplinary expertise, plus bring fresh perspectives that may help to shape the field for the better
### Conclusion
- they point to some other threats to academic freedom (external lobbying) that they say are worse than no-platforming
- Overall, think yes it's true that the university is a particular environment and it's not the public square (there are hardly any public squares nowadays though!! Twitter might call itself one, but it's a private company). 
- But, I think the Greer & similar no platforming cases are quite difficult to defend. When the standards of a field are up for debate, I don't think you get to disinvite speakers from the side of the argument that you don't like!!
## Speech Acts and Unspeakable Acts
### introduction
- mostly about pornography: is it speech, is it an act, etc
- some examples that try to "undermine the dichotomy between word and action"
> On MacKinnon's view pornography is speech, not conduct, but it is speech that should be left unprotected for the same kinds of reasons that other actions are sometimes left unprotected: because of the effects they have, and because of the actions they are
- An interesting claim: pornography silences women, i.e. removes their liberty to free expression
	- so it's not a conflict between free speech and equal treatment, but rather between a pornographer's free speech and a woman's
- "The ability to perform speech acts of certain kinds can be a mark of political power"
	- conversely, women are unable to perform certain kinds of speech acts because of their lack of political power. Pornography may be a contributor to this.
- Main goal seems to be
	- (1) arguing that pornography subordinates women: "a conflict between liberty and equality"
	- (2) arguing that pornography silences women: "a conflict between liberty and liberty"
- Says that 
> the twin feminist claims are certainly coherent, and, granting some not entirely implausible empirical assumptions, they may well be true
- but won't talk about how the law ought to respond, in terms of censorship.
### "Pornography subordinates"
> pornography has a particular illocutionary force: it ranks women as sex objects, and legitimates that kind of behavior
- as a result, it has a perlocutionary effect of
> making its hearers more likely to view women as inferior, more disposed to accept rape myths, more likely to view rape victims as deserving of their treatment, and more likely to say that they themselves would rape if they could get away with it
- in order for subordination to occur from a speech act, the speaker must be authoritative
	- "pornographic speech is authoritative within a certain domain-the game of sex"
	- "In this domain, and for these hearers \[those who seem to learn that violence is sexy and coercion legitimate], it may be that pornography has all the authority of a monopoly"
	- hmm. But if pornography is causing people \[men] to believe things, and those people themselves have authority in the domain of sex due to power imbalances, which is what many feminists would argue(?), then isn't it a superfluous step in the argument to talk about whether pornography itself has authority?
		- I guess maybe the response would be to say: well, regulate the problem behaviour, not the legitimate pornographic speech that foolish, wicked people are learning the wrong conclusions from 
	- 
### "Pornography silences"
> Is it possible to silence someone, not by ordering or threatening them into simple silence, not by frustrating their perlocutionary goals, but by making their speech acts unspeakable?
- this is a helpful example to illustrate the difference between perlocution and illocution:
	- When a judge says "silence in the courtroom", the illocution is a command trying to make everyone be quiet. The perlocution is that everyone is quiet. But people in the courthouse could still be disobedient and heckle; their illocutionary abilities are not disabled.
	- "A homosexual who says "I do" does not disobediently marry; he does not marry"
- In a sexual context, a woman who says "no" can have that fail to work in two ways (p321)
	- the hearer recognises that she is refusing, but rapes her
	- she says the word "no", "but what she says misfires"
		- I think what this is gesturing at (p324) is that pornography makes men unaware of the idea that a woman might not give consent, since it depicts "no" as meaning "yes"; it thereby "twists her words"
- There's also a very good example in the case of "Ordeal" (p321 & p326), again about how pornography can turn the speech act of a woman's protest into something simply sexual, and so it does not achieve its goal


### conclusion
- Speech can subordinate people...
> (a) when it unfairly ranks members of a social group as inferior, (b) when it legitimates discriminatory behavior towards them, and (c) when it unjustly deprives them of some important power
- and pornography does the first two of these
- pornography can also silence, i.e. deprives women of an important power
- but to do this, it must be "authoritative", \[could look back and see what that means]
	- p305: *authoritative illocutions* - those that are successful only when the speaker has authority in a relevant domain, e.g. the umpire saying "fault" in a game of tennis as opposed to just a spectator saying the same thing
- Maybe this means that liberal governments should regulate pornography; other people e.g. Dworkin have argued that
> it it is wrong for a government to allow private citizens to violate the liberty of other citizens by preventing them from saying what they wish
-
