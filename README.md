# PPE notes
Contains my notes from lectures, tutorials, and readings in the first year of PPE at Oxford. Also contains my marked solutions to problem sets for economics and logic.

Most of these are handwritten, and have been scanned then converted to .md format using the excellent [OneNote2MarkDown](https://github.com/theohbrothers/ConvertOneNote2MarkDown) script. Out of an abundance of regard for copyright, I've omitted the PDFs of lecture slides and problem sheets, though I've left in the syllabi and reading lists to be cross-referenced with my notes. The folders called "Lecture-slides" contain my notes from the lecture, if I attended; the "Tutorials" folders have my notes from those, if I made any.
